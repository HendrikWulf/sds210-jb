:::{glossary}

Accessor
: In Python libraries, an *accessor* is a way to attach specialized functionality to an existing data structure without changing its core implementation.  
  For example, libraries such as `xarray` add accessors to objects like a `Dataset` to provide domain-specific {term}`methods <Method>` and properties.

[Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
: An *application programming interface* (API) is a defined set of rules and tools that allow different pieces of {term}`software` to communicate and exchange information.  
  For example, the Nominatim service provides an API for accessing its geocoding functionality.

[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
: See {term}`Application Programming Interface`.

Argument
: A value passed to a {term}`function` when it is called.  
  Compare with a {term}`Parameter`, which refers to the variable name used in the function definition.

[Aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_(geography))
: Aspect describes the compass direction that a {term}`slope` faces and is derived from elevation data.  
  It is usually measured in degrees from 0° (north) to 360°.

[Assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development))
: A statement used in a Python program to check whether a condition evaluates to `True` when the code is executed.  
  If the condition is not `True`, an `AssertionError` is raised. Assertions are commonly used for debugging and testing code.

Attribute
: A value or variable that is associated with an instance of a specific data type or {term}`Class`.  
  Attributes represent static characteristics or properties of an object and are accessed using dot notation without parentheses.

[Camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
: A variable naming convention in which words are joined without spaces, with each new word starting with a capital letter (except the first).  
  Example: `gpsStationId`.  
  Compare with {term}`Snake case`.

[Case sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity)
: A property of a programming language where uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct.

[Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(programming))
: A reusable template for creating {term}`objects <Object>` that share common properties and behavior.  
  For example, a class representing a geospatial point may store coordinates and provide methods such as distance calculations.

  It defines the coordinate system, projection, and mathematical model needed to locate positions accurately and exchange geographic data between systems.

Coordinate transformation
: See {term}`Map reprojection`.

: A raster representation in which each cell value indicates the cost (e.g. time, energy, money, or difficulty) required to traverse that cell.  
  Cost surfaces are commonly used to compute least-cost paths or accumulated cost in spatial analysis.

  It supports data manipulation tasks such as filtering, aggregation, and merging and is a core structure for data analysis in Python.

Data model

: An EPSG code is a numeric identifier that uniquely defines a {term}`Coordinate Reference System` (CRS) or a spatial data transformation.  
  Examples include EPSG:4326 for WGS84 and EPSG:3857 for Web Mercator, which simplify referencing CRSs in geographic data processing.

  Compare with {term}`Georeferencing`, which assigns spatial reference to data rather than translating addresses.

  Each row represents a geometry (e.g. point, line, or polygon) with associated attributes and supports spatial operations such as spatial joins.

Geographic coordinate conversion
: See {term}`Map reprojection`.

: The process of assigning real-world coordinates to data that initially lack spatial reference, such as scanned maps or images.  
  Unlike {term}`Geocoding`, georeferencing does not involve address-based lookup.

Git push
: A Git command that uploads local {term}`commits <Git commit>` to a remote {term}`repository`, making changes available to others.
