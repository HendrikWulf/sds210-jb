```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

Now that you know how to safely project the Earth onto a flat metric grid, you can start analyzing it! GeoPandas allows you to move beyond simply viewing data to actively creating new geospatial metrics (like surface area and border length) and engineering entirely new geometric shapes (like proximity buffers and bounding boxes).

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★★ (Measuring areas and generating proximity buffers are mandatory skills for lab assignments)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★★ (Provides the analytical toolset needed to answer real-world spatial queries)  
**Foundation:** ★★★ (Teaches the core topological and geometric operations that make spatial data science unique)  

**Time to Read:** 15 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Learn to actively analyze spatial data by calculating areas and perimeters, finding centroids, drawing proximity buffers, and simplifying complex geometries.  
**Skip this if:** You are already highly proficient with Shapely geometry operations within GeoPandas (`.area`, `.length`, `.centroid`, `.buffer()`, `.simplify()`, `.envelope`, `.convex_hull`).

```

In the previous sections, we learned how to load spatial files and navigate the complexities of **{term}`Coordinate Reference Systems <Coordinate Reference System>`** (CRS). Up until now, we have only been visualizing existing shapes.

This section marks your transition into active spatial analysis. You will learn how to interrogate your geometries to generate numeric measurements and manipulate them to create brand new derived shapes.

```{admonition} Advanced Plotting
:class: warning

In the upcoming examples, you will see some new mapping techniques, such as drawing multiple layers on top of each other (`ax=ax`) or creating side-by-side maps using `plt.subplots`. 

**Do not worry about memorizing this plotting syntax right now!** We will formally introduce all of these visualization tools in the next session. For now, treat these maps as a "sneak preview" of what is possible, and keep your focus entirely on the new spatial concepts being presented (like calculating areas, drawing buffers, and modifying shapes).

```

## 1. The CRS Warning

Before we calculate a single number, it is important to establish a key rule in spatial analysis.

**Never calculate area or length on data that is still in degrees (EPSG:4326) or in the **{term}`Web Mercator`** projection (EPSG:3857)!**

If you try to calculate the area of a forest using degrees (4326), your result will be in "square degrees," which is a physically meaningless unit. Fortunately, GeoPandas will usually throw a red warning if you attempt this.

However, Web Mercator (3857) is a silent killer. Because it is technically a metric projection, GeoPandas will not warn you; it will happily calculate the area in square meters. But because Web Mercator famously stretches the map the further you move from the equator, your measurements will be massively inflated. For example, at 60° latitude (e.g., Oslo, Norway), the linear scale is doubled, meaning the calculated **area** is actually **4× too large!**

### The Solution

Always use an **Equal Area** projection or a highly accurate **Local Metric** projection before doing spatial math:

* **Global Level:** Use Equal Earth (EPSG:8857).
* **European Level:** Use ETRS89 / LAEA (EPSG:3035).
* **Switzerland Level:** Use the official Swiss grid CH1903+ / LV95 (EPSG:2056).

For the rest of this lesson, we will make sure our data is projected into the highly accurate Swiss EPSG:2056 metric grid.

---

## 2. Calculating Area and Length

Because our active geometry column is powered by the Shapely library, GeoPandas automatically knows the mathematical properties of every shape in our dataset.

We can extract these properties instantly using `.geometry.area` and `.geometry.length` (which calculates the perimeter for polygons or the distance for lines).

Let us load our Swiss Cantons dataset, verify it is in our metric projection (EPSG:2056), and find out which canton has the largest area and which has the longest border.

```{code-cell} python
import geopandas as gpd

# Load the cantons dataset
cantons_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/swissBoundaries3D_cantons.gpkg")

# 1. Calculate Area (Returns square meters, so we divide by 1,000,000 for sq km)
cantons_gdf["area_sqkm"] = cantons_gdf.geometry.area / 10**6

# 2. Calculate Perimeter/Border Length (Returns meters, so we divide by 1000 for km)
cantons_gdf["border_km"] = cantons_gdf.geometry.length / 1000

# Top 3 Cantons by Area
print("Largest Cantons (Area):")
display(cantons_gdf[["name", "area_sqkm"]].sort_values(by="area_sqkm", ascending=False).head(3).round(1))

# Top 3 Cantons by Border Length
print("\nLongest Borders (Perimeter):")
display(cantons_gdf[["name", "border_km"]].sort_values(by="border_km", ascending=False).head(3).round(1))

```

**Before you look at the results:** Run the code above and compare the two lists. Are the exact same cantons in the top 3, and is their order exactly the same?

```{admonition} Output and Observation
:class: dropdown

**Largest Cantons (Area):**

| | name | area_sqkm |
|---|---|---|
| **14** | Graubünden | 7105.3 |
| **22** | Bern | 5938.9 |
| **2** | Valais | 5224.6 |

**Longest Borders (Perimeter):**

| | name | border_km |
|---|---|---|
| **22** | Bern | 786.2 |
| **14** | Graubünden | 758.0 |
| **15** | Vaud | 622.0 |


```

Notice that the rankings do not perfectly match! While Graubünden has the largest surface area, Bern actually has a longer continuous border. Furthermore, Valais drops out of the top three entirely for perimeter, replaced by Vaud.

This highlights a fundamental concept in spatial data: **shape complexity**. A territory with a highly irregular, jagged boundary, complex shorelines, or multiple separated enclaves will yield a much longer perimeter than a relatively compact territory of similar size.

We can easily prove this visually by plotting our new `border_km` column:

```{code-cell} python
# Visualize the shape complexity by coloring cantons by their border length
cantons_gdf.plot(
    column="border_km",
    cmap="viridis",
    figsize=(10, 6),
    legend=True,
    legend_kwds={'label': "Border Length (km)"},
    edgecolor="white"
);

```

## 3. Extracting Centroids

The **centroid** is the mathematical center of mass of a geometry. Extracting centroids is incredibly useful when you need to represent large, complex polygons (like a country or a city) as a single simplified point—for example, to place a text label on a map or to calculate the distance between two regions.

Let us load the national boundary dataset and extract the exact geographic center of Switzerland.

```{code-cell} python
# Load the national boundaries
ch_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/swissBoundaries3D_switzerland.gpkg")

# Extract the centroid (This generates a new GeoSeries containing Point geometries)
ch_centroid = ch_gdf.geometry.centroid

```

### How to Layer Maps (Overlays)

Up to this point, we have only plotted one dataset at a time. To see which canton the center point falls inside, we need to draw the point *on top* of the cantons map.

In GeoPandas, layering maps is done by saving the first plot as a variable (usually called `ax`, short for "axis" or canvas). When we generate the second plot, we pass `ax=ax` as an argument, which tells GeoPandas: *"Do not create a new plot; draw this on top of the existing canvas!"*

```{code-cell} python
# 1. Draw the base map (Cantons) and save the canvas as 'ax'
ax = cantons_gdf.plot(figsize=(10, 6), color="whitesmoke", edgecolor="lightgrey");

# 2. Draw the centroids ON TOP of the base map by passing 'ax=ax'
ch_centroid.plot(ax=ax, color="red", marker="x", markersize=100);

ax.set_title("The Geographic Center(s) of Switzerland")

```

```{admonition} What do you expect to find at the center of Switzerland?
:class: dropdown

:::{figure} images/15_Geographical_centre_of_Switzerland.png
:alt: An aerial satellite view of a grassy alpine meadow. At the center is a large, low, jagged stone wall structure that precisely traces the outline shape of Switzerland's border. Inside the shape are some small triangular markers and a public fire pit/BBQ area. The structure is surrounded by high-altitude pine trees and a small, lone wooden building to the upper right.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*It’s actually a BBQ place!* Since the precise spot is difficult to access, the people of Obwalden built a public fire pit at the true center of mass. The stone walls you see from space are built to perfectly trace the jagged shape of Switzerland's actual border, with the center marker right at the heart of the pit.
:::

```

### Wait, why are there *four* red crosses?

If you look closely at your map, there isn't just one center point! There is one in the middle of Switzerland, one to the east, and two more near the borders. Why did this happen?

Remember from the previous section that our `ch_gdf` dataset actually contains **4 distinct rows** (The main landmass of Switzerland, the nation of Liechtenstein, and two small enclaves belonging to Germany and Italy).

Because GeoPandas applies geometric operations *row-by-row* to the entire dataset, it perfectly calculated the center of mass for all four independent territories at the exact same time!

### Isolating a Single Geometry

So, how do we get *just* the true center of Switzerland without those extra three points?

Because GeoPandas is built directly on top of Pandas, **all your standard Pandas filtering skills still work perfectly!** If we want to isolate the geometry for Switzerland, we simply filter the **{term}`DataFrame`** using the `name` column before we calculate the centroid:

```{code-cell} python
# 1. Filter the dataset to only keep the row named "Schweiz"
ch_mainland = ch_gdf[ch_gdf["name"] == "Schweiz"]

# 2. Now calculate the centroid of this filtered dataset
true_center = ch_mainland.geometry.centroid

print("Success! We isolated the single center point:")
print(true_center)

```

```{admonition} Centroids outside the shape!
:class: warning
For highly irregular, "C-shaped", or crescent polygons, the mathematical center of mass might actually fall *outside* the polygon itself! If you need a point that is guaranteed to be inside the shape (like for dropping a map pin), use `.representative_point()` instead of `.centroid`.

```

---

## 4. Creating Buffers

A **buffer** is a geometric operation that draws a zone of influence around a shape. It expands the original geometry outward in all directions by a specified distance. This is the cornerstone of proximity analysis (e.g., "How many houses are within 500 meters of this train station?").

To demonstrate this, we will load a **{term}`CSV <Comma-separated values>`** of Swiss nuclear power plants. According to safety protocols, there are two critical radii around a plant:

* **Zone 1 (16 km):** Plume Exposure (Requires immediate action, evacuation, or sheltering).
* **Zone 2 (80 km):** Ingestion Pathway (Requires monitoring of water and agriculture).

Let us convert our CSV to a **{term}`GeoDataFrame`** and draw these exact zones.

*Note: If you look closely at the raw CSV data, the coordinates are not longitude/latitude degrees; they are massive numbers stored in columns named `X` and `Y`. This tells us the provider already projected the data into the Swiss metric grid for us! We just need to make sure we assign the correct CRS when we build the GeoDataFrame.*

```{code-cell} python
import pandas as pd

# 1. Load the CSV
npp_df = pd.read_csv("data/NuclearPowerPlant.csv")

# 2. Convert to a spatial GeoDataFrame
# Because the data is already metric, we set the CRS directly to EPSG:2056
npp_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    npp_df, 
    geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(npp_df.X, npp_df.Y),
    crs="EPSG:2056" 
)

# 3. Create the Buffers 
# Because our CRS is already in meters, we can safely buffer by 16,000 and 80,000
# This creates completely new geometry objects
zone_1_evac = npp_gdf.geometry.buffer(16000)
zone_2_monitor = npp_gdf.geometry.buffer(80000)

# 4. Plot the results layered over the Swiss border
ax = ch_gdf.plot(figsize=(10, 6), color="none", edgecolor="black", linewidth=1.5);
zone_2_monitor.plot(ax=ax, color="orange", alpha=0.3, label="80km Monitoring");
zone_1_evac.plot(ax=ax, color="red", alpha=0.5, label="16km Evacuation");
npp_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color="black", marker="*", markersize=50);

ax.set_title("Nuclear Safety Zones in Switzerland")

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->

#### Concept Check: The Massive Buffer

You load a GeoDataFrame of city centers and apply a 500-meter proximity zone using `.buffer(500)`. When you plot the result, your "500-meter" circles completely engulf the entire continent of Europe. What is the most likely cause of this error?

A) You used Web Mercator (EPSG:3857), which distorted the area.

B) Your GeoDataFrame is still in a geographic CRS (like EPSG:4326), so you accidentally buffered by 500 *degrees*, not meters.

C) The `.buffer()` function only accepts distances in kilometers, so it calculated 500 kilometers.

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B**
Because `.buffer()` uses the underlying units of the active coordinate system, buffering a geographic CRS (measured in degrees) by "500" creates a massive shape that is 500 degrees wide! Always project your data into a metric CRS (like EPSG:2056) before using distance-based geometry operations.

```

## 5. Simplifying and Bounding

Sometimes your geometric data is too complex. A highly detailed national border might contain tens of thousands of vertices. This makes the file massive and slow to render on web maps.

GeoPandas provides several tools to simplify geometries or create bounding boxes around them. We will use the highly detailed canton of Grisons (`grisons_gdf`) to demonstrate three common simplification methods.

### The Tools

* **`.simplify(tolerance)`:** Reduces the number of vertices. The `tolerance` defines how far the new simplified line is allowed to deviate from the original shape (in the units of your CRS, so meters for us).
* **`.envelope` (Bounding Box):** Draws the tightest possible rectangular box that completely encloses the shape, perfectly aligned to the X and Y axes.
* **`.convex_hull`:** Draws the tightest possible convex polygon around the shape. Imagine snapping a tight rubber band around the outermost points of the geometry.

### Side-by-Side Plotting (Subplots)

To see the difference between these three tools clearly, it is best to put the maps next to each other. To do this, we borrow a feature from Python's core plotting library (**{term}`matplotlib <Matplotlib>`**) called **{term}`subplots <Subplots>`**.

Think of `plt.subplots(1, 3)` as building a single large picture frame (`fig`) that contains a grid of 1 row and 3 columns. Inside that frame are three blank canvases (`ax1`, `ax2`, and `ax3`). We can then tell GeoPandas exactly which canvas to draw on!

```{code-cell} python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import geopandas as gpd

# Load the canton of Grisons
grisons_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/swissBoundaries3D_grisons.gpkg")

# 1. Simplify (Allow the shape to deviate by up to 5000 meters)
grisons_simple = grisons_gdf.geometry.simplify(tolerance=5000)

# 2. Bounding Box (Envelope)
grisons_box = grisons_gdf.geometry.envelope

# 3. Convex Hull (Rubber band)
grisons_hull = grisons_gdf.geometry.convex_hull

# --- Plotting the comparisons ---

# Create the frame (fig) and the 3 canvases (ax1, ax2, ax3)
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

# Canvas 1: Simplify
grisons_gdf.plot(ax=ax1, color="lightgrey");
grisons_simple.plot(ax=ax1, color="none", edgecolor="blue", linewidth=2);
ax1.set_title("Simplified (5km tolerance)")
ax1.axis("off") # This hides the coordinate numbers to make it look cleaner

# Canvas 2: Envelope
grisons_gdf.plot(ax=ax2, color="lightgrey");
grisons_box.plot(ax=ax2, color="none", edgecolor="red", linewidth=2);
ax2.set_title("Envelope (Bounding Box)")
ax2.axis("off")

# Canvas 3: Convex Hull
grisons_gdf.plot(ax=ax3, color="lightgrey");
grisons_hull.plot(ax=ax3, color="none", edgecolor="green", linewidth=2);
ax3.set_title("Convex Hull")
ax3.axis("off")

# Display the final frame
plt.show()

```

You have a dataset of hundreds of GPS points tracking a wolf pack over a year. You want to draw a single polygon around all these points to represent the wolf pack's absolute "territory".

Which bounding method would give you a more scientifically accurate, tighter representation of the territory?

A) `.envelope`

B) `.convex_hull`

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B**
While both would contain all the points, an `.envelope` creates a strict rectangle aligned to the North/South and East/West axes (Bounding Box). This usually captures huge amounts of empty space in the corners where the wolves never actually went. A `.convex_hull` (the "rubber band" method) wraps tightly to the outermost GPS points, providing a much closer and more realistic approximation of the true territory.

```

## 6. Exercise: The Shape Shifter

It is time to combine everything you have learned. In this exercise, you will manipulate the geometry of Switzerland, create derived shapes, and calculate the distance between them.

*(Before you code, make a mental guess: If we draw a convex hull around a 10 km buffered outline of Switzerland, how far away will the centroid of that new shape be from the original center of Switzerland? 0 kilometers? 1 kilometer? 10 kilometers?)*

**Tasks:**

1. **Isolate and Extract:** First, filter `ch_gdf` to only keep the row where the name is "Schweiz" (to remove the enclaves). Then, extract its outer borderline using `ch_boundary = ch_mainland.geometry.boundary`.
2. **Buffer the Boundary:** Create a 10 km (10,000 meter) buffer around that new boundary line.
3. **Measure:** Calculate the surface area of this new buffered border ring in square kilometers.
4. **Hull:** Create a `convex_hull` around your new buffered shape.
5. **Centroids:** Calculate the centroid of your new convex hull, and the centroid of the original filtered Switzerland polygon.
6. **Distance:** Use the `.distance()` method to find the exact distance in meters between the two centroids. *(Hint: Because centroids are stored in a **{term}`GeoSeries**`, you should extract the raw point geometry first using `.values[0]` to do the math: e.g., `point_a.values[0].distance(point_b.values[0])`)*. Was your guess close?

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

## 7. Summary: Geometric Operations

In this section, you progressed from managing spatial files to performing active spatial analysis. You now have the skills to interrogate geometries for data and twist them into new analytical shapes.

### Key takeaways

* **The Cardinal Rule:** Never run area, length, or distance calculations on data in degrees (EPSG:4326) or Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). Always use a reliable metric projection like EPSG:2056.
* **Extraction:** Use `.area`, `.length`, and `.centroid` to generate new numerical columns and representative center points from your shapes.
* **Modification:** Use `.buffer(distance)` to build zones of influence for proximity analysis.
* **Simplification:** Use `.simplify()`, `.envelope`, and `.convex_hull` to reduce geometry complexity, speed up processing, and draw geographic boundaries around point clusters.

### What comes next?

Up to this point, we have only been working with one geometric layer at a time. We learned how to draw an 80-kilometer buffer around a nuclear power plant, but we haven't answered the most important question: *How many people actually live inside that buffer?*

To answer questions like that, we need to compare two completely different datasets. In the next section, **Spatial Relationships (Topological Queries)**, you will learn how to ask spatial questions. You will discover how to test if a point is `within` a polygon, if two lines `intersect`, and how to use geography itself as a filter to seamlessly link different datasets together!
