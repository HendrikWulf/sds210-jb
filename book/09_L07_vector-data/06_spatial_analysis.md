```{admonition} Big Idea
:class: tip

The ultimate power of a Geographic Information System lies in fusing disparate datasets together. In this section, you will learn how to transfer attributes between layers based on their physical location, merge adjacent shapes into larger territories, and literally cut geometries into pieces using spatial overlays. 
```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★☆ (Directly relates to the Reflection in Practical L7; spatial joins (`.sjoin()`) are the optimized, professional alternative to the manual loop written in Part 5)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★★ (Essential for linking multi-source data where no common ID exists, heavily utilized in projects 1, 2, and 4)  
**Foundation:** ★★★ (The pinnacle of vector geoprocessing)  

**Time to Read:** 20 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Combine completely disparate datasets together by using geographic location as the joining key, and physically cut geometries into new analytical shapes using overlays.  
**Skip this if:** You are fully proficient with GeoPandas `.sjoin()` (understanding the `how` and `predicate` parameters), `.dissolve()`, and `.overlay()` algorithms.

```

In the previous section, we learned how to ask spatial questions to filter our data (e.g., finding all primary homes inside an evacuation zone).

Now, we will take the final step in vector analysis: **Data Fusion**. You will learn how to permanently combine the geometries and attributes of entirely different datasets to engineer new, multi-dimensional analytical tables.

```{admonition} Data Preparation

## 1. The Limitation of Pandas Merges

In standard data science, when you want to combine two tables, you use `pd.merge()`. However, a standard table merge requires a shared column (like a unique ID or a matching name) to act as the "key" between the two datasets.

But what happens when your datasets have no matching columns?

Imagine you have a dataset of Alpine huts containing only names and GPS coordinates, and a dataset of Swiss cantons containing population statistics. If you want to know exactly which canton each hut belongs to, a standard Pandas merge is completely useless. The datasets share no text or ID columns.

To solve this, we must use geography itself as the joining key!

---

## 2. Spatial Joins (sjoin)

A **{term}`Spatial join`** (`.sjoin()`) transfers the **{term}`attributes <Attribute>`** of one layer to another based on their spatial relationship.

If a point falls inside a polygon, GeoPandas will grab the attributes of that polygon and permanently attach them to the point's row in the attribute table.

:::

Let us answer the question: **Which Swiss canton has the highest number of Alpine huts?** We will spatially join the cantons to the huts, and then count the results.

```{code-cell} python
import geopandas as gpd

# 1. Load the data and ensure matching metric CRS
cantons_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/swissBoundaries3D_cantons.gpkg").to_crs(epsg=2056)
huts_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/alpine_huts.gpkg").to_crs(epsg=2056)

# 2. Perform the Spatial Join
# We keep the Huts geometry (left) and attach Canton attributes (right)
# where the hut is "within" the canton polygon.
huts_with_cantons = gpd.sjoin(
    huts_gdf, 
    cantons_gdf, 
    how="inner", 
    predicate="within"
)

# 3. View the fused attribute table
display(huts_with_cantons[["name_left", "name_right"]].head(3))
```

```{admonition} Why did the column names change?
:class: note
Notice how our output columns are now called `name_left` and `name_right`. Because both of our original datasets happened to have a column simply called `name`, GeoPandas automatically added suffixes during the join to prevent the data from overwriting itself! `name_left` is the hut (from our primary left side dataset), and `name_right` is the newly attached canton.
```

### The Anatomy of a Spatial Join

If you look at the `.sjoin()` code above, you will notice two very specific arguments: `predicate="within"` and `how="inner"`. These two parameters give you total control over how the spatial data is combined, and changing them can drastically alter your results.

Let us use the diagrams below to understand exactly how these parameters work.

:::{figure} images/26_spatial-join-alternatives.png
:alt: A diagram showing 6 points and 4 polygons (A, B, C, D). It demonstrates how changing the spatial predicate (within vs intersects) and join type (inner, left outer, right outer) changes the resulting attribute table.
:width: 800px
:align: center

*Spatial Join Alternatives: Notice how the fate of Point 3 (outside all polygons) and Point 6 (exactly on a border) changes depending on the parameters we choose. Source: [Geopython](https://python-gis-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/part2/chapter-06/nb/06-spatial-join.html#the-basic-logic-of-spatial-join)*
:::

**1. The Spatial Predicate (`predicate`)**
The predicate defines the strict geometric rule for the join. It is crucial to pick a rule that makes logical sense (e.g., checking if points are *within* a polygon makes sense, but checking if points *contain* a polygon does not).

* **`within` (See Result Table *i*):** This requires the point to be *strictly* inside the boundary. Look at **Point 6**: because it sits exactly on the border of Polygon C, it is not considered "inside", so it is entirely dropped from the results in table *i*.
* **`intersects` (See Result Table *ii*):** This is more forgiving. If geometries share even a single pixel of space, it is a match. Because **Point 6** touches the border of Polygon C, it successfully joins and appears in table *ii*.

**2. The Join Type (`how`)**
The join type determines what happens to geometries that completely fail the spatial predicate rule (like **Point 3**, which is floating out in the middle of nowhere).

* **{term}`Inner join`** (`how="inner"`): The default, strict option. As seen in tables *i* and *ii*, **Point 3** is completely deleted from the final dataset because it could not find a matching polygon. If an Alpine hut is located just across the border in Italy, it is dropped.
* **{term}`Left outer join`** (`how="left"`): The safe option. Look at result table *iii*. The "Left" dataset (Layer 1: Points) is prioritized. Every single point is kept. **Point 3** survives, but because it has no overlapping polygon, its new columns simply say `No data` (or **{term}`NaN`** in Pandas).
* **Right Outer Join (`how="right"`):** Look at result table *iv*. The "Right" dataset (Layer 2: Polygons) is prioritized. Every single polygon is kept. **Polygon D** has zero points inside it, but it is kept in the final table with `No data` in the point columns.

:::{figure} images/27_spatial_join_anatomy.png
:alt: A two-part diagram. The top part contrasts 'Within' (point entirely inside a shape) with 'Intersects' (point touching the shape's border). The bottom part contrasts an 'Inner Join' (drops points outside the shape) with a 'Left Join' (keeps all points, but assigns 'NaN' or missing data to points outside the shape).

#### Concept Check: The Disappearing Data

**Scenario:** You have a Point dataset of all 300 hospitals in Switzerland and a Polygon dataset of high-risk avalanche zones. You want to create a safety report that lists *every single hospital in the country*, with an extra column indicating if it is in an avalanche zone or not.

Which join type must you use to ensure hospitals in safe zones are not deleted from your final table?

A) `how="left"`
B) `how="inner"`
C) `how="right"`  

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: A**
A Left Outer Join (`how="left"`) prioritizes your primary left dataset (the hospitals). It will keep every single hospital in the table. If a hospital is not inside an avalanche polygon, GeoPandas will safely fill the avalanche attribute columns with `NaN` (Not a Number). If you used `how="inner"`, any hospital outside an avalanche zone would be permanently deleted from your results!
```

### Aggregating the Fused Data

Now that every individual hut has a canton name securely attached to it, we can use a standard Pandas `.groupby()` to count them up!

```{code-cell} python
# Group by the canton name and count the occurrences
hut_counts = huts_with_cantons.groupby("name_right").size()

print("Top 5 Cantons by number of Alpine Huts:")
display(hut_counts.sort_values(ascending=False).head(5))
```

By fusing the attributes based on location, we seamlessly transition from spatial data back into standard statistical analysis.

## 3. Dissolving Geometries (dissolve)

If `.sjoin()` is the spatial equivalent of a Pandas merge, then **`.dissolve()`** is the spatial equivalent of a Pandas groupby.

Dissolving takes multiple adjacent geometries that share the same attribute and physically melts their borders together into a single, massive geometry. Simultaneously, it allows you to aggregate (sum, average, etc.) the numeric attributes of those melted shapes.

Let us test this. We will load the Swiss Municipalities dataset. First, we will use a spatial join to figure out which canton each municipality belongs to. Then, we will dissolve the thousands of tiny municipalities back into large cantonal boundaries, summing up their population (`einwohnerzahl`) and surface area along the way!

```{code-cell} python
import geopandas as gpd

# 1. Load municipalities and ensure metric CRS
muni_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/swissBoundaries3D_municipalities.gpkg").to_crs(epsg=2056)

# 2. Assign Canton names to Municipalities via a Spatial Join
muni_with_cantons = gpd.sjoin(muni_gdf, cantons_gdf[["name", "geometry"]], predicate="within")

# 3. Dissolve! 
# Group by the attached canton name ('name_right')
# Sum the population, lake area, and municipal area for the new melted shape
cantons_rebuilt = muni_with_cantons.dissolve(
    by="name_right",
    aggfunc={
        "einwohnerzahl": "sum",
        "see_flaeche": "sum",
        "gem_flaeche": "sum"
    }
)

# 4. View the result of our manual aggregation
display(cantons_rebuilt[["einwohnerzahl", "gem_flaeche", "see_flaeche"]].round(0).astype(int).sort_values("see_flaeche", ascending=False).head(5))
```

Because we just engineered entirely new polygons and summed up their data from scratch, it is good practice to verify our math. Let us compare our `cantons_rebuilt` data against the official statistics stored in the original `cantons_gdf`:

```{code-cell} python
# 5. Compare results with the official cantonal attributes
display(cantons_gdf
        .set_index("name")
        [["einwohnerzahl", "kantonsflaeche", "see_flaeche"]]
        .round(0)
        .astype(int)
        .sort_values("see_flaeche", ascending=False)
        .head(5)
        )
```

The numbers match perfectly! Best quality made by SwissTopo. By dissolving the municipalities, we successfully recreated the cantonal dataset from the ground up.

We can visually prove that this operation physically melted the geometries together by plotting our original municipalities next to our newly dissolved `cantons_rebuilt` layer:

```{code-cell} python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a side-by-side plot layout
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))

# Plot 1: Thousands of individual municipalities
muni_gdf.plot(ax=ax1, color="whitesmoke", edgecolor="darkgrey", linewidth=0.2)
ax1.set_title("Original Municipalities")
ax1.axis("off")

# Plot 2: The newly dissolved cantons
cantons_rebuilt.plot(ax=ax2, color="whitesmoke", edgecolor="black", linewidth=0.2)
ax2.set_title("Dissolved into Cantons")
ax2.axis("off")

plt.show()
```

## 4. Spatial Overlays (overlay)

Spatial Joins (`sjoin`) only transfer attributes; they never alter the actual shapes of your geometries. But what if you need to physically cut a geometry into smaller pieces?

A **Spatial Overlay** (`.overlay()`) mathematically intersects two layers, physically slicing the geometries exactly where they cross boundaries to create entirely new shapes.

:::{figure} images/30_vector_overlay_processes.png
:alt: Four diagrams illustrating vector overlay operations (Intersection, Union, Difference, and Symmetric difference) between a circle and two adjoining rectangles. The resulting geometries for each operation are shaded in green, demonstrating how the layers are physically cut and combined.

Source: [GeoPython](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-06/nb/08-overlay-analysis-with-vector-data.html#vector-overlay-operations)*
:::

When performing an overlay, you use the `how` parameter to control exactly which parts of the sliced geometries are kept in the final dataset. The five main operations are:

* **`intersection`**: Keeps only the areas where the two layers overlap.
* **`union`**: Keeps all geometries from both layers, splitting them into new distinct pieces wherever their borders cross.
* **`difference`**: Keeps only the areas of the first layer that *do not* overlap with the second layer.
* **`symmetric_difference`**: Keeps the areas from both layers that *do not* overlap (the exact opposite of intersection).
* **`identity`**: Computes a geometric intersection, but keeps all features of the primary input layer, splitting them where they overlap the second layer.

### Applying an Intersection Overlay

To demonstrate why this is vital, let us calculate the total length of highways in each canton. A highway is typically a single, continuous line that spans across multiple cantons. If we just did a spatial join, the entire length of the highway would be assigned to just one canton. We must use `.overlay()` to physically cut the highway lines at the cantonal borders first!

```{code-cell} python
# 1. Load the Highways
highways_gdf = gpd.read_file("data/swissHighways.gpkg").set_crs(epsg=2056, allow_override=True)

# 2. Perform the Overlay (Cut the lines at the polygon boundaries)
highways_cut = gpd.overlay(highways_gdf, cantons_gdf, how="intersection")

# 3. Recalculate Length! 
# Because the lines were physically chopped, we MUST calculate their new lengths
highways_cut["length_km"] = highways_cut.geometry.length / 1000

# 4. Group by Canton and sum the new lengths
highway_density = highways_cut.groupby("name")["length_km"].sum()

print("Cantons with the most Highway Kilometers:")
display(highway_density.sort_values(ascending=False).head(3).round(1))

# --- Plotting the Results ---
# Draw the cantons base map
ax = cantons_gdf.plot(color="whitesmoke", edgecolor="lightgrey", figsize=(10, 6))

# Draw the cut highways on top, colored by their new assigned Canton!
highways_cut.plot(ax=ax, column="name", cmap="tab20", linewidth=2)

ax.set_title("Highways Cut and Colored by Cantonal Borders")
ax.set_axis_off()
```

</figcaption>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

Because `.overlay()` computationally slices thousands of vertices, it is one of the heaviest operations in GeoPandas. However, it is absolutely essential when dealing with long networks like rivers, roads, or animal migration paths that cross administrative boundaries.

#### Concept Check: The Attribute Trap

**Scenario:** You have a Polygon representing a large farm. In its attribute table, the `area_sqkm` column says **10**. You use `.overlay(how="intersection")` to physically cut the farm exactly in half using a municipal border.

If you immediately look at the attribute table of your two newly cut farm pieces, what will their `area_sqkm` columns say?

A) 5  
B) 10  
C) NaN (No data)  

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B (10)**
When you use `.overlay()`, GeoPandas physically cuts the geometries, but it **does not** automatically recalculate the numbers in your old attribute columns! Both new halves will simply inherit the original "10" from the parent shape. Whenever you use `.overlay()` to cut lines or polygons, you should recalculate your length and area columns using `.geometry.length` or `.geometry.area` to avoid unintended maths errors later.
```

## 5. Exercise: Aggregating by Area

It is time to put your fusion skills to the test. In the event of a severe emergency, helicopter transport is crucial. You have been asked to determine which Swiss canton has the highest number of registered hospital landing sites.

You will need to use a Spatial Join to combine the points and polygons, and then aggregate the results.

**Tasks:**

1. **Load Data:** Load `hospital_landing_sites.geojson` and `swissBoundaries3D_cantons.gpkg`. Ensure both are in the metric `EPSG:2056` projection.
2. **Spatial Join:** Perform an `sjoin` keeping the landing sites as the primary (left) geometry, and joining the canton attributes based on the `within` predicate.
3. **Aggregate:** Use `.groupby()` on the newly attached canton name column and count the number of landing sites per canton.
4. **Identify:** Sort the results in descending order and print the top 5 cantons.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

## 6. Summary: Fusing Data

Congratulations! You have mastered the core toolkit of vector spatial analysis. You are no longer just looking at maps; you are actively engineering new spatial insights by combining datasets that otherwise could not communicate.

### Key takeaways

* **The Power of Geography:** When datasets lack matching ID columns, geography acts as the universal key to connect them.
* **Spatial Joins (`.sjoin()`):** Use this to transfer attribute data from one layer to another based on spatial relationships (like points inside polygons) without altering the physical geometries.
* **Dissolving (`.dissolve()`):** The spatial equivalent of groupby. Use this to physically melt adjacent boundaries together while aggregating their numeric attributes.
* **Overlays (`.overlay()`):** Use this to physically cut and slice geometries at boundaries. Always remember to recalculate your areas and lengths after performing an overlay, as the physical shapes have permanently changed!

### What comes next?

You have successfully engineered new spatial datasets and aggregated complex statistics across regions. But how do we effectively communicate these numbers to an audience?

If you look back at the hospital map we just created, we used a continuous color gradient. While it looks nice, the human brain actually struggles to interpret the exact difference between two similar shades of blue.

To make our maps truly readable, we need to group our raw numbers into logical "bins" (e.g., "Low", "Medium", and "High" density). In the next section, **Data Classification**, you will learn how to bridge the gap between raw data and clear visual communication using rule-based logic and statistical grouping methods!
