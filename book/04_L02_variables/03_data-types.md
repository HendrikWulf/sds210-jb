```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

{term}`Variables <Variable>` store values.  
**{term}`Data types <Data type>`** describe what kind of values those are and what operations make sense for them.

While variables hold values in memory, data types determine how Python interprets those values when they are used in {term}`expressions <Expression>` and calculations.

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★☆ (Required to understand float conversion behavior and accurately answer the conceptual question in Part 3: Expressions and data types.)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★★ (Vital for distinguishing between textual categories and numeric IDs in project 1, or parsing raw string outputs from JSON web data in project 2.)  
**Foundation:** ★★★ (An important core programming concept that explains why certain syntax combinations crash.)  

**Time to Read:** 20 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Data types define how Python interprets the values you store, dictating what mathematical or logical operations are allowed and explaining why certain errors occur.  
**Skip this if:** You already know the difference between `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`, and know how to use `type()` to cast variables and debug `TypeError`s.

```

In this chapter, you will learn how Python classifies values, how to inspect their data types, and how data types explain both successful operations and common errors.

Understanding data types is essential for {term}`debugging <Debugging>` and for writing code that behaves predictably. These ideas will form a foundation for calculations, comparisons, and logical decisions later in the course.

---

## 1. What Is a Data Type?

A data type describes what kind of value a variable stores. It also defines how that value behaves when Python uses it in expressions or calculations.

Every variable in Python has a data type, even if you do not specify it explicitly. The data type controls two important things:

* which operations are allowed
* how Python interprets an expression

This explains why some lines of code work as expected while others fail, even if the syntax looks correct. Think of the data type as the *role* of a value. The same symbol can behave very differently depending on what type of value it represents.

For example, text behaves differently from numbers:

```{code-cell} python
weather_forecast = "Hot"


```

Here, the variable stores **text**, not a number. Because of this, Python will treat the value as a word rather than something that can be used in mathematical calculations.

You do not need to memorize all data types yet. The key idea is this:

> Variables store values. Data types define how those values behave.

In the next chapters, we will look at common data types and see how Python reacts when we combine them.

---

## 2. The Four Basic Data Types in Python

Python provides several data types, but we begin with the **four basic types** that store **single values**.

The four primitive data types in Python with common spatial examples.
:::

| Data type name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | Whole integer values | `4` |
| `float` | Decimal values | `3.1415` |
| `str` | Character strings | `"Hot"` |
| `bool` | True or false values | `True` |

These types are often called *primitive* data types. They represent individual values rather than collections of values. At this stage, your goal is to **recognize** them when you see them in code.

### 2.1 Integers (int)

**{term}`Integers <Integer>`** are **whole numbers**. They do not contain a decimal point.
They are commonly used for:

* counts (e.g., number of weather stations)
* indices
* IDs

```{code-cell} python
num_points = 120


```

The value `120` is a whole number, so Python assigns it the data type `int`.

### 2.2 Floating Point Numbers (float)

**{term}`Floating point numbers <Floating-point number>`** represent **decimal values**. They can store numbers with a fractional part.
Typical uses include:

* measurements
* coordinates
* temperatures

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius = 37.6


```

Because the value contains a decimal point, Python interprets it as a `float`.

### 2.3 Strings (str)

**{term}`Strings <String>`** represent **text data**. They are always written inside quotation marks (single or double).
Strings are often used for:

* labels and names
* categories
* metadata and descriptions

```{code-cell} python
weather_forecast = "Hot"


```

Even if a string contains numbers (like `"120"`), Python treats it as text, not as a mathematical value.

### 2.4 Booleans (bool)

**{term}`Booleans <Boolean>`** represent **logical values**. They can only be exactly one of two values: `True` or `False` (notice the capital letters).
Typical uses include:

* flags
* yes or no states
* on or off decisions

```{code-cell} python
is_georeferenced = True


```

Booleans are especially important when making decisions in code, which you will explore later.

---

## 3. Checking Data Types with `type()`

When working with variables, it is often not obvious what data type a value has. This is especially true once values come from data files or complex calculations.

Python provides a simple diagnostic tool for this purpose: the `type()` function. It does not change a variable; it only **inspects** it.

```{code-cell} python
type(weather_forecast)


```

Python returns `str`. It tells us that `weather_forecast` is a string.

Now compare this with a numeric value:

```{code-cell} python
type(temp_celsius)


```

Python returns `float`.

In many cases, the **first step in debugging** is to ask: *What data type does this variable actually have?* Understanding the data type often explains why an operation works, fails, or behaves in an unexpected way.

---

## 4. Mismatch of Data Types: `TypeError`

Not all operations are allowed for all data types. When Python encounters an operation that is not defined for the given types, it refuses to execute it.

Consider the following expression:

```python
temp_celsius + weather_forecast

```

At first glance, this may look harmless. However, `temp_celsius` is a number (`float`), while `weather_forecast` is text (`str`). Python tries to interpret what the `+` operation should mean here and then stops, raising a **{term}`TypeError`**.

This error tells you something important:

* the operation is not defined for these data types together
* numbers and strings behave differently
* Python will not guess what you meant

A `TypeError` is not a mistake you should fear. It is Python being precise and protective. Think of it as Python saying: *"I know what addition means for numbers. I know what it means for text. But I do not know what it means to add a number to text."*

---

## 5. What Works with Strings?

Before learning formal rules, it is useful to **observe what Python actually does**. Try these operations and observe the results.

Start by defining two string variables:

```{code-cell} python
a = "Hot"
b = "Cold"

```

### Add two strings

```{code-cell} python
a + b


```

```{admonition} What happens?
:class: dropdown
Python merges the two texts together (called *concatenation*). The output is `'HotCold'`.


```

### Subtract two strings

```{code-cell} python
a - b


```

```{admonition} What happens?
:class: dropdown
Python raises a `TypeError`. You can stick words together with `+`, but it makes no logical sense to subtract the word "Cold" from the word "Hot".


```

### Multiply a string by a number

```{code-cell} python
a * 3


```

```{admonition} What happens?
:class: dropdown
Python repeats the string! The output is `'HotHotHot'`.


```

Do not try to memorize rules. Instead, focus on **patterns**: some operations work, some do not, and Python is consistent in how it behaves.

---

## 6. Combining Different Data Types

Different data types are not automatically compatible, but they can often be made compatible.

Consider this realistic example of a temperature reading imported from a text file:

```{code-cell} python
forecast_bahnhofstrasse = "39.0"


```

At first glance, this looks like a number. However, the quotation marks mean it is stored as **text**.

```{code-cell} python
type(forecast_bahnhofstrasse) # Returns: str


```

If we want to compare this value mathematically with a temperature stored as a number, we must first check the data types involved. **Inspection comes before fixing.** Once you understand what each variable represents, you can make them compatible by explicitly converting one data type into another.

---

## 7. Converting Data Types (Type Casting)

Sometimes values have the *right information* but the *wrong data type*. In these cases, Python does not guess what you want to do. You must tell it explicitly. This is called **{term}`type casting <Type conversion>`**.

Type casting creates a **new value** with a different data type.

:::{figure} images/05_type-casting.png
:alt: Type casting transforms a value from one data type to another, allowing you to turn string text into usable numeric data.
:width: 700px
:align: center

Type casting transforms a value from one data type to another, allowing you to turn string text into usable numeric data.
:::

### 7.1 Converting to `float()`

To use our string `"39.0"` in calculations, we convert it explicitly:

```{code-cell} python
forecast_high = float(forecast_bahnhofstrasse)


```

Now inspect the result:

```{code-cell} python
type(forecast_high) # Returns: float


```

Because the data types are now compatible, we can perform calculations:

```{code-cell} python
forecast_high - temp_celsius


```

### 7.2 Converting to `int()` and a Subtle Pitfall

You can also convert numeric values to integers:

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius_int = int(temp_celsius)


```

If the original value contains a decimal part, Python **{term}`truncates <Truncation>`** it. It removes the decimal completely; **it does not round**.

For example, `int(62.9)` becomes `62`, not `63`.

This distinction matters heavily in spatial data:

* truncation can silently reduce precision
* small errors can accumulate
* results may look plausible but be entirely wrong

Type conversion should always be a conscious decision. Ask yourself: *Is losing the decimal part acceptable here?*

---

## 8. When Conversion Fails: `ValueError`

Type conversion only works when the **content** of a value makes sense for the requested data type.

Consider this example:

```{code-cell} python
float("Cold")


```

Here, we ask Python to convert a string into a floating point number. Python attempts the conversion and stops, raising a **{term}`ValueError`**.

A `ValueError` tells you that the conversion itself is a valid *idea*, but the *actual content* does not make sense. Only strings that contain numeric content, such as `"77.0"` or `"-12"`, can be converted to numeric types.

Think of a `ValueError` as Python saying: *"I understand you want a float. But I cannot magically turn the letters C-o-l-d into a number."*

#### Concept Check: Decoding the Error

You are building a script to calculate elevation changes. You read a value from a messy text file, storing it as `start_elevation = "1425.5"`. Because you only care about whole meters, you attempt to run the following code:

```python
clean_elevation = int(start_elevation)

```

Python immediately crashes and displays an error. Based on what you just learned, what kind of error is this, and why did it happen?

A) `TypeError`, because `int()` only accepts floats, not strings.

B) `ValueError`, because the string contains a decimal point, meaning its internal contents are invalid for a direct `int()` conversion.

C) `SyntaxError`, because the variable is missing quotation marks.

````{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B**
It is a `ValueError`. The *idea* of converting a string to an integer is allowed (which is why it is not a `TypeError`), but the *contents* of this specific string (`"1425.5"`) confuse Python because integers cannot contain decimals. To fix this, you would first need to convert the string to a decimal using `float("1425.5")`, and *then* you could convert that float into an integer using `int()`.

## 9. Short Exercises

These exercises build on each other. Focus on understanding what Python does and *why*.

### Exercise 1: Recognizing Data Types

Consider the following variables:

```{code-cell} python
a = 25
b = 25.0
c = "25"
d = False


```

1. For each variable, write down what data type you expect.
2. Use `type()` to check your answers.
3. Identify which variables *look similar* but behave differently.

````{admonition} Sample solution (click to expand)
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
type(a)   # int (whole number)
type(b)   # float (includes a decimal point)
type(c)   # str (enclosed in quotation marks)
type(d)   # bool (logical state)
```

Variables `a`, `b`, and `c` may look similar to a human, but they behave completely differently in Python because their data types dictate their behavior.


````

### Exercise 2: Inspection Before Fixing

You are given two variables:

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius = 37.6
forecast_bahnhofstrasse = "39.0"


```

1. Check the data type of each variable.
2. Predict what will happen when you run: `forecast_bahnhofstrasse - temp_celsius`
3. Run the code and observe the error. Explain **why** Python refuses this operation.

````{admonition} Sample solution (click to expand)
:class: dropdown

Checking data types:
```{code-cell} python
type(temp_celsius)              # float
type(forecast_bahnhofstrasse)   # str
```

Python raises a **`TypeError`**. It refuses this operation because subtraction is not defined between text and a number. Even though `"39.0"` looks like a number, it is stored as text.


````

### Exercise 3: Making Values Compatible

Continue with the variables from Exercise 2.

1. Convert `forecast_bahnhofstrasse` into a numeric value and subtract `temp_celsius` from it.
2. Convert `temp_celsius` to an integer and inspect the result.
3. Compare the values before and after conversion. Why could this difference matter in spatial analysis?

```{code-cell} python
# Do the exercise here

```

````{admonition} Sample solution (click to expand)
:class: dropdown

Converting the string to a numeric value makes the math work:
```{code-cell} python
forecast_bahnhof = float(forecast_bahnhofstrasse)
forecast_bahnhof - temp_celsius
```

Converting the temperature to an integer truncates the data:
```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius_int = int(temp_celsius)
print(temp_celsius)      # 37.6
print(temp_celsius_int)  # 37
```

This matters in spatial analysis because truncation destroys precision. A coordinate truncated from `47.37` to `47` would move a point by several kilometers!


````

---

## 10. Summary

At this point, you should understand the following core ideas:

* **Every variable has a data type.** Python assigns it based on the stored value.
* **Data types control allowed operations.** They determine how Python interprets expressions and why combinations (like adding strings) work differently than math.
* **Use `type()` to diagnose problems.** When something behaves unexpectedly, checking the data type is your first step.
* **`TypeError` vs `ValueError`.** A `TypeError` means the types don't mix. A `ValueError` means the data type is right, but the contents inside don't make sense for the operation.
* **Explicit conversion (casting).** Functions like `float()` and `int()` allow you to convert values, but be aware of pitfalls like truncation.

---

### What Comes Next

So far, you have focused on **what values are** and **how Python understands them**.

The next step is to focus on **what you can do with those values**.

In the next chapter, you will build on this foundation by applying data types in more complex expressions and operations.
Understanding operators and expressions will let you move from *storing values* to *doing things with values*, which is the core of programming.
