```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

Printing makes results visible.  
Formatting makes results understandable.

Clear output supports debugging, communication, and learning.

```

So far, you have worked with values, expressions, and strings. In many cases, you have seen that Python already shows results automatically when you run a notebook cell.

In this section, you will learn **when and why to print values explicitly** and how to format output so it is readable, professional, and meaningful.

---

## 1. Notebook Output vs `print()`

In a Jupyter Notebook, the **last expression in a code cell** is displayed automatically.

```{code-cell} python
2 + 3  # This will display 5 below the cell

```

This automatic display is highly convenient when you are exploring values interactively. However, it has clear limitations:

* It only shows the **last expression** in a cell.
* It only displays **one value**.
* It is a **notebook-specific feature** (it will not work if you write a standard Python script later).

### Using the `print()` function

The `print()` function sends output to the screen explicitly.

```{code-cell} python
print(2 + 3)

```

Printing works consistently everywhere: in notebooks, in scripts, and in massive software programs. This makes `print()` essential for debugging, explaining steps, and clearly communicating your final results.

```{admonition} Key idea
:class: note
Automatic display is a **notebook feature**.  
`print()` is a **Python feature**.

When clarity matters, or when you need to show multiple things from one cell, rely on `print()`.

```

## 2. Printing Multiple Values

The `print()` function can display **multiple values at once** if you separate them with commas. Python automatically inserts a space between each value.

```{code-cell} python
distance_km = 120
speed_kmh = 80

# Quick inspection of multiple variables
print(distance_km, speed_kmh)

```

Output becomes much clearer when you add text labels. Clear labels turn raw numbers into meaningful information, helping your future self (and others) understand what the numbers represent.

```{code-cell} python
print("Distance:", distance_km, "Speed:", speed_kmh)

```

---

## 3. Formatting Output with f-strings

While separating items with commas works, modern Python provides a much more powerful tool for readable output: **f-strings**.

F-strings allow you to embed variable values directly into the middle of a text string.

```{code-cell} python
travel_time_h = distance_km / speed_kmh

print(f"The travel time is {travel_time_h} hours.")

```

*The anatomy of an f-string: combining fixed text, dynamic variables, and formatting rules.*
:::

**How it works:**

1. The `f` before the quotation mark tells Python: *"This is a formatted string."*
2. The curly braces `{}` act as placeholders.
3. Python evaluates whatever is inside the `{}` and injects the value directly into the text.

You can even put full mathematical expressions inside the brackets!

```{code-cell} python
print(f"If we double our speed, we will go {speed_kmh * 2} km/h.")

```

---

### Formatting Numbers

At times, calculations produce long, ugly decimals (e.g., `1.50000000002`). You can control **how numbers are displayed** by adding formatting rules inside the f-string brackets using a colon `:`.

```{code-cell} python
# Format the variable to show only 2 decimal places
print(f"Travel time: {travel_time_h:.2f} hours")

```

The part after the colon `:.2f` defines the formatting rule:

* `.2` specifies **two digits after the decimal point**.
* `f` formats the value as a standard **floating-point number**.

### Other Common Number Formats

Different format specifiers change how numbers appear:

```{code-cell} python
value = 1.2345

print(f"{value:.2f}")   # decimal format
print(f"{value:.2e}")   # scientific notation
print(f"{value:.2%}")   # percentage

x = 1.2345
y = 5
```

| Format | Meaning                              | What it does                             | Example f-string | Displayed result |
| -----: | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
|    `f` | fixed-point decimal (floating point) | Displays the number as a decimal value   | `f"{x:.2f}"`     | `1.23`           |
|    `e` | scientific notation                  | Displays the number in exponential form  | `f"{x:.2e}"`     | `1.23e+00`       |
|    `%` | percentage                           | Multiplies the value by 100 and adds `%` | `f"{x:.2%}"`     | `123.45%`        |
|    `d` | integer (whole numbers only)         | Displays a whole number without decimals | `f"{y:d}"`       | `5`              |

This affects **only the output**, not the stored value.

---

```{admonition} Note
:class: note

Formatting is about presentation, not calculation.

The value in memory stays the same.  
Only the displayed text changes.
```

This distinction is essential when presenting results, debugging, or comparing outputs.

---

## 4. Why Formatting Matters

Clear output helps you understand what your code is doing, communicate results to stakeholders, and spot mistakes easily. Poorly formatted output forces the reader to guess.

### Printing as a Debugging Tool

Printing intermediate values is one of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques in data science. If a complex calculation is giving you the wrong answer, print out the pieces!

```{code-cell} python
print("Distance:", distance_km)
print("Speed:", speed_kmh)
print("Time:", travel_time_h)
```

You can also use an f-string to make the output more readable.

```{code-cell} python
print(f"Distance = {distance_km} km, Speed = {speed_kmh} km/h, Time = {travel_time_h:.2f} h")
```

This allows you to verify that values are correct at each specific step and quickly identify exactly where the math went wrong.

## 5. Short Exercise

Many migratory birds travel long distances over several days. To understand such movements, we often estimate **travel time** from distance and average **airspeed**.

Assume a migratory bird is flying from Northern Europe to Southern Europe. The estimated migration distance is:

```{code-cell} python
distance_km = 1800

```

Two possible average airspeeds are:

* **10 m/s** (slower sustained flight)
* **15 m/s** (faster sustained flight)

### Task

1. Convert both airspeeds from **m/s to km/h** (Hint: multiply by `3.6`).
2. Compute the estimated **travel time in hours** for **both speeds**.
3. Display the results using **clear, formatted f-strings** that:

* state the distance and the airspeed used
* include correct units
* round the final travel time to **two decimal places**

1. Add **one debug print statement** that would help you verify the unit conversion worked correctly.

``````{admonition} Sample solution (click to expand)
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
# Migration distance
distance_km = 1800

# Airspeeds in meters per second
speed_ms_slow = 10
speed_ms_fast = 15

# 1. Convert airspeed from m/s to km/h
speed_kmh_slow = speed_ms_slow * 3.6
speed_kmh_fast = speed_ms_fast * 3.6

# 2. Calculate travel times
time_h_slow = distance_km / speed_kmh_slow
time_h_fast = distance_km / speed_kmh_fast

# 3. Formatted f-string output
print(f"At {speed_ms_slow} m/s, the migration takes {time_h_slow:.2f} hours.")
print(f"At {speed_ms_fast} m/s, the migration takes {time_h_fast:.2f} hours.")

# 4. Debugging output to verify unit conversion
print(f"\nDEBUG -> speeds (km/h): Slow={speed_kmh_slow:.1f}, Fast={speed_kmh_fast:.1f}")
```

``````

## 6. Summary

After this section, you should understand that:

* Notebooks display the last expression automatically, but `print()` makes output explicit and works in all Python environments.
* Multiple values can be printed together by separating them with commas.
* **f-strings** (`f"Text {variable}"`) are the modern, clean way to embed variables directly into text.
* Formatting rules (like `:.2f`) alter how values visually appear on the screen without changing the underlying stored data.
* Printing well-labeled outputs is a crucial habit for debugging and communication.

### Looking Ahead

You now know how to see and present individual results clearly.

Next, we move on to **multi-item variables** (Lists and Dictionaries), which allow a single variable to store massive collections of values—like hundreds of spatial coordinates or attributes—at the same time!
