```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip
{term}`Variables <Variable>` allow us to store values, reuse results, and build readable workflows instead of repeating calculations.

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★☆ (Essential for assigning coordinates and names in Part 1: Single-value variables, but the core logic is basic enough to not be a strict bottleneck.)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★★ (Forms the absolute baseline for storing datasets and parameters across all projects: 1, 2, 3, and 4.)  
**Foundation:** ★★★ (The core programming concept for memory management and state tracking.)  

**Time to Read:** 15 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Variables are how Python stores data in memory, allowing you to cleanly reuse and update values instead of constantly typing out raw numbers.  
**Skip this if:** You already know how to assign values (`x = 10`), update them, and understand that variables store independent snapshots rather than active mathematical links.

```

In this chapter, you will learn how Python uses variables to keep track of values in memory and how those values can be reused and updated throughout a {term}`program <Program>`. You will also see how variables behave in a {term}`Jupyter Notebook <Notebook>`, why {term}`execution order <Execution order>` matters, and how small changes to one variable affect (or do not affect) others.

These concepts form the foundation for all later {term}`programming <Computer programming>` tasks in this course, from simple calculations to more complex geospatial workflows.

## 1. What Is a Variable?

A **variable** is a way to **store a value in memory** so that it can be reused later in your code.

You can think of a variable as a **label** that **points to a value** stored somewhere in memory.

A variable name is a label that points to a value stored in memory.
:::

A variable is **not** the value itself, and it is **not** a container that remembers history. It always points to **one current value**. Once a value is stored, you can use the variable's name in calculations instead of typing the raw number again and again.

### Assigning a Value to a Variable

To create a variable, you use the **{term}`assignment operator <Assignment operator>`** `=`.

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius = 10.0

```

* `temp_celsius` is the **variable name**
* `=` assigns the value on the right to the name on the left
* `10.0` is the **stored value**

```{admonition} Important
:class: note
Assigning a variable does **not** produce any output.  
The value is stored silently in memory.

```

---

### Why Variables Are Useful

Instead of repeating values like `10.0` in multiple places, you can:

* give the value a **meaningful name**
* reuse it in calculations
* change it later in one place

You will use variables constantly when working with coordinates, distances, and other geospatial values.

---

## 2. Seeing Variable Values

In a **Jupyter Notebook**, you can display the value of a variable simply by writing its name as the last line of a {term}`code cell <Code cell>`.

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius

```

**Why does this work?** Jupyter Notebooks have a special, convenient behaviour: *The output of the last {term}`expression <Expression>` in a code cell is displayed automatically.*

### Using `print()`

If you want to display multiple things from a single cell, or add formatted text, you must use the `print()` {term}`function <Function>` explicitly. This works in any Python environment, not just notebooks.

```{code-cell} python
print("Temperature in Celsius:", temp_celsius)

```

---

## 3. Using Variables in Calculations

Once a value is stored in a variable, you can use that variable **just like a number** in calculations. Let’s convert our temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```{code-cell} python
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", 9 / 5 * temp_celsius + 32)

```

When this cell is executed, Python looks up the current value stored in `temp_celsius` (which is `10.0`), substitutes it into the math expression, evaluates the calculation, and displays the result.

Variables allow you to reuse values in many different calculations, avoid repeating numbers, and change a value once to update it everywhere it is used.

---

## 4. Define Your Own Variable

Let’s pause briefly and try this yourself.

**Task:**

1. Define **one variable of your choice** (e.g., representing a distance, a speed, or a count).
2. Assign it any numeric value you like.
3. Display its value in the notebook.

*Tip: Use a **meaningful variable name** formatted in **{term}`snake_case <Snake case>`** (words separated by underscores).*

```{code-cell} python
# Define and display your variable here


```

---

## 5. Updating Variables

Variables are **not fixed**. Their values can be changed by assigning a new value to the same variable name. This is called **reassignment**.

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius = 17.0
print("Temperature in Celsius is now:", temp_celsius)

```

When this cell is executed, the new value `17.0` is stored in `temp_celsius`. The previous value (`10.0`) is **replaced** and is no longer available.

```{admonition} Mental Model
:class: tip
**Variables do not remember past values.** A variable always points to **one current value**—the most recent one that was assigned to it.

```

---

## 6. Execution Order and `NameError`

In a Jupyter Notebook, **code cells are executed in the order you run them**, not necessarily in the order they appear on the page. Look at the numbers in brackets `[ ]` next to your cells—they show the execution order.

Let’s see what happens if we try to use a variable that has **not been defined yet**.

```{code-cell} python
print(5 / 9 * (temp_fahrenheit - 32))

```

Running this cell raises a `NameError`.

**Why?** Because the variable `temp_fahrenheit` does **not exist yet** in memory. Variables are only created *after* the cell defining them has been executed.

```{admonition} Common beginner pitfall
:class: warning
If you see a `NameError`, or if a calculation looks "wrong", it usually means:
- the variable has not been defined yet
- a required cell was not run (or was run out of order)
- you forgot to rerun a calculation after updating an input variable

```

To fix the error, we must first define the variable by running this cell:

```{code-cell} python
temp_fahrenheit = 9 / 5 * temp_celsius + 32

```

Once this cell has been run, the variable exists in memory, and you can rerun the previous cell successfully.

---

## 7. Variables Are Independent

An important and sometimes surprising behaviour in Python is that **variables are independent of each other**.

Let’s update `temp_celsius` one more time and inspect both variables together:

```{code-cell} python
temp_celsius = 20.0
print(
    "Temperature in Celsius is now:",
    temp_celsius,
    "and temperature in Fahrenheit is still:",
    temp_fahrenheit,
)

```

Even though `temp_fahrenheit` was originally calculated using `temp_celsius`, its value does **not** change when `temp_celsius` changes!

### Why Does This Happen?

Python stores **values**, not **relationships**.

:::{figure} images/02_variable-values.png
:alt: Variables store a snapshot of a value at a specific time. They do not remember the relationship between inputs.
:width: 700px
:align: center

Variables store a snapshot of a value at a specific time. They do not remember the relationship between inputs.
:::

When we defined `temp_fahrenheit`, Python performed the math right then and stored the final result. It does not remember *how* that value was computed, only *what* value was stored. Changing one variable does **not** trigger automatic updates in others.

If you want dependent values to change, you must **recalculate them explicitly** by running the calculation cell again.

    Click the "Run Next Step" button to step through the Python script line by line and watch how the computer's memory updates. Notice that when <code>temp_celsius</code> is updated to 20.0 in the final step, <code>temp_fahrenheit</code> remains completely unaffected at 50.0. This visualizes how variables store independent snapshots of values rather than active mathematical links.

#### Concept Check: The Memory Snapshot

You are running a short spatial script and execute the following three lines of code in order:

```python
x_coordinate = 10
y_coordinate = x_coordinate + 5
x_coordinate = 20

```

If you print the value of `y_coordinate` right now, what will Python output?

A) 15

B) 25

C) 10

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: A**
Python variables store values, not relationships. When `y_coordinate` was defined on the second line, `x_coordinate` was exactly 10, so `y_coordinate` permanently stored the snapshot value of 15. Updating `x_coordinate` to 20 later on does not automatically flow backwards and update `y_coordinate`.

```

## 8. Short Exercise

This exercise revises the key ideas from this chapter.

### Task

1. Define a variable called `distance_km` with a numeric value.
2. Define a second variable `speed_kmh`.
3. Compute the travel time in hours and store it in a new variable called `travel_time_hours`.
4. Display the result.
5. Update the value of `speed_kmh` and **re-run the calculation** to see the new travel time.

```{code-cell} python
# Do the exercise here


```

Try to complete this yourself before checking the example solution below.

````{admonition} Example solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
# 1 & 2. Define the input variables
distance_km = 120
speed_kmh = 60

# 3. Compute travel time and store it
travel_time_hours = distance_km / speed_kmh

# 4. Display the result
print("Initial travel time (hours):", travel_time_hours)

# 5. Update speed and explicitly recalculate
speed_kmh = 80
travel_time_hours = distance_km / speed_kmh

print("New travel time (hours):", travel_time_hours)

```

**Key takeaways:**

* Reassigning `speed_kmh` replaces its old value.
* `travel_time_hours` did not update automatically when speed changed; we had to write the calculation again to get the new result.
* The notebook displays exactly what is currently held in memory based on the order we executed the commands.

## 9. Summary

After completing this chapter, you should understand that:

* **Variables store values in memory** for later reuse.
* Assigning a variable does **not** produce output.
* A variable’s value changes **only when it is reassigned**.
* **Execution order matters** deeply in Jupyter Notebooks.
* Variables are independent; they do **not** update each other automatically.

These ideas form the foundation for everything that follows in this course.
