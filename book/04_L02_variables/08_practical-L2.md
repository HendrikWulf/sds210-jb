# Practical L2

<div class="page-subtitle">
From single variables to structured spatial calculations
</div>

---

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HendrikWulf/sds210-jb/blob/main/book/04_L02_variables/08_practical-L2.ipynb)

## Learning objectives

After completing this practical, you will be able to:

* define and name variables clearly
* choose appropriate data types for spatial attributes
* group related values using lists and dictionaries
* perform simple numeric expressions on spatial data
* calculate **Manhattan** and **Euclidean** distances using coordinates
* store computed results in a structured and reusable way

---

## Practical storyline

In this practical, you will gradually build a **small spatial data model** for three Swiss cities (**Zurich, Lugano, Geneva**).

You will start with **single variables**, then group values into **lists**, and finally organise everything into **dictionaries**, ending with distance calculations between cities.

This mirrors how spatial data handling evolves in real projects.

## Part 1 – Single-value variables

Single variables store exactly one value. They are useful for names, labels, and individual measurements.

### Code

```{code-cell} python
# City names
z = "Zurich"
g = "Geneva"
l = "Lugano"

print(z, g, l)

```

### Tasks

1. Change the order of the printed city names.
2. The variable names `z`, `g`, and `l` are poor choices. Rename them to better follow the descriptive naming conventions learned earlier in this chapter.
3. Add a short comment explaining what each variable represents.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Part 2 – Variables and formatted output

Variables can also store numeric values, which can be combined with text to create human-readable output.

### Code

```{code-cell} python
# Approximate travel distances (km)
dist_zurich_geneva = 280
dist_zurich_lugano = 205
dist_geneva_lugano = 370

# Old-style concatenation
print("The distance from " + z + " to " + g + " is " + str(dist_zurich_geneva) + " km")

```

### Tasks

1. Modify the print statement to show the distance from Zurich to Lugano.
2. Rewrite the print statement using a modern **f-string** for better readability.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Part 3 – Expressions and data types

Numeric variables can be combined using operators to perform calculations.

### Code

```{code-cell} python
x = 2
y = x ** 2
z_val = y ** 0.5

print(f"{x} squared is {y} and the square root of {y} is {z_val}")
print(f"{x} is of type {type(x)}, {y} is of type {type(y)}, and {z_val} is of type {type(z_val)}")

```

### Tasks

1. Change the value of `x` and rerun the cell.
2. Observe how the **data types** change.
3. Explain (in a comment) why the square root results in a `float` data type even if the answer is a whole number.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Part 4 – Coordinates as lists

Some values naturally belong together, such as coordinates. Lists are a great way to group them.

### Code

```{code-cell} python
# CH1903+ coordinates (example values)
zurich_coords = [26, 12]
geneva_coords = [25, 11]
lugano_coords = [27, 10]

# Access individual coordinate values using indexing
print("Zurich x:", zurich_coords[0])
print("Zurich y:", zurich_coords[1])

```

### Tasks

1. Replace the example coordinates above with real Swiss CH1903+ values by looking them up on [map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch).
2. Add a comment explaining why a **list** (or a **tuple**) is a suitable data structure for coordinates.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Part 5 – Organising cities

Dictionaries allow us to link **keys** (names) to **values** (coordinates), making our data much easier to query.

### Code

```{code-cell} python
cities = {
    "Zurich": zurich_coords,
    "Geneva": geneva_coords,
    "Lugano": lugano_coords
}

print(cities)

# Show what is stored in our keys and values
print(cities.keys())
print(cities.values())

# Retrieve coordinates from the dictionary
cz = cities["Zurich"]
cg = cities["Geneva"]
cl = cities["Lugano"]

```

### Tasks

1. Print the coordinates of Geneva explicitly using the dictionary.
2. Explain (in a comment) why dictionaries are more flexible and powerful than storing individual variables for every city.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

## Part 6 – Manhattan distance

*Euclidean distance represents the shortest straight-line path between two points, while Manhattan distance calculates the distance strictly along a grid.*
:::

The **Manhattan distance** measures distance by strictly following a grid (like walking city blocks). The formula is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates:

$$d = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$

> **Mathematical Trick:** To calculate the absolute value (removing any negative signs) using only basic operators, we square the difference (which forces it to be positive), and then take the square root (`** 0.5`). Later in the course, we will learn a simpler built-in function for this!

### Code

```{code-cell} python
# Manhattan distance: Zurich – Lugano

dx = cz[0] - cl[0]
dx = dx ** 2
dx = dx ** 0.5  # Square root to get absolute value

dy = cz[1] - cl[1]
dy = dy ** 2
dy = dy ** 0.5  # Square root to get absolute value

manhattan_zl = dx + dy

print(f"Manhattan distance from Zurich to Lugano is {manhattan_zl}")

```

### Tasks

1. Calculate the Manhattan distance between Zurich & Geneva, and Lugano & Geneva.
2. Store the results in appropriately named new variables.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Part 7 – Euclidean distance

The **Euclidean distance** calculates the straight-line distance between two points using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$$

### Code

```{code-cell} python
# Euclidean distance: Zurich – Lugano

dx = cz[0] - cl[0]
dy = cz[1] - cl[1]

euclidean_zl = (dx**2 + dy**2) ** 0.5

print(f"Euclidean distance from Zurich to Lugano is {euclidean_zl}")

```

### Tasks

1. Compute the Euclidean distance between Zurich & Geneva, and Lugano & Geneva.
2. Print both Manhattan and Euclidean distances clearly using f-strings. Which one is always shorter?

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Part 8 – Storing distance results

Computed values are also data and should be stored systematically so we can look them up later.

### Code

```{code-cell} python
distances = {
    "Zurich_Lugano": {
        "manhattan": manhattan_zl,
        "euclidean": euclidean_zl
    }
}

print(distances)

```

### Tasks

1. Extend this dictionary to include the distances for Zurich–Geneva.
2. Add the distances for Lugano–Geneva.
3. Inspect the structure and explain (in a comment) how this resembles an attribute table in GIS.

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Reflection

Take a moment to review what you've built. Answer briefly in comments or markdown:

1. Why are **lists** (or tuples) suitable for coordinates?
2. Why are **dictionaries** useful for spatial data?
3. Which step helped you most to understand how Python executes mathematical distance calculations?

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

---

## Optional challenge

Design a single comprehensive dictionary that stores:

* city name
* coordinates
* distances to other cities

You do **not** need to automate anything yet. Focus solely on structure and clarity. How would you design the "perfect" data structure to hold all this information?

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

### What Comes Next

So far, you have learned how to **store** and **access** multiple values. But calculating the distances between just three cities manually took a lot of typing. Imagine doing this for 1,000 cities!

The next step is to **process collections automatically**. Next, you will learn about **loops and conditional logic**, which allow your code to:

* work through collections element by element
* make decisions based on values and conditions
* apply the same operation to massive datasets in a structured way
