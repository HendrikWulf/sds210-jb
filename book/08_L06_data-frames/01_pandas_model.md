```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip
When working with pure Python, you pass your data into functions. In Pandas, your data comes with its own built in tools. 

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★☆☆ (Conceptual foundation; not directly tied to a specific code task in Practical L6, but provides the necessary context for the entire lab.)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★☆ (Provides the OOP foundation needed for managing DataFrames across all projects 1, 2, 3, and 4.)  
**Foundation:** ★★★ (The shift to Object-Oriented Pandas logic is a critical learning threshold in Python data science.)  

**Time to Read:** 10 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Master the mental shift from standard Python functions to Pandas' object-oriented data structures, enabling powerful tabular data manipulation.  
**Skip this if:** You are already highly proficient with Pandas DataFrames, Series, Indexes, and object-oriented dot notation.

```

Before diving into any spatial analysis, we need to adjust how we think about data in Python. Up until now, you have been using **{term}`procedural programming <Procedural programming>`**: storing data in basic **{term}`lists <List>`** or **{term}`dictionaries <Dictionary>`**, and then passing that data into separate functions.

Pandas introduces an **{term}`Object Oriented Programming <Object-oriented programming>`** approach. In Pandas, data structures are not just passive containers; they are powerful objects that contain both your data and the tools needed to manipulate it.

---

## 1. Series vs. DataFrames

To understand Pandas, you only need to understand two new data structures, which have direct equivalents to the basic Python you already know.

* **{term}`Series`**: You can think of a Pandas Series as a clever, super charged Python list. It holds a one dimensional sequence of values.
* **{term}`DataFrame`**: A DataFrame is a two dimensional structure for storing tabular data with rows and columns. You can think of a DataFrame as a programmable spreadsheet. Under the hood, a DataFrame is essentially a dictionary of Series, where each column is a single Series sharing the same index.

:::

```{code-cell} python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series (like a list)
cities = pd.Series(["Zurich", "Geneva", "Bern", "Basel"])

# Creating a DataFrame (like a dictionary of lists)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "City": cities,
    "Population": [415000, 201000, 133000, 177000]
})

print(data)

```

---

## 2. Objects and Methods

Because Pandas is Object Oriented, you will notice a major syntax shift in how you write code.

In standard Python, if you want to know how many items are in a list, you pass the list into an external function:
`len(my_list)`

In Pandas, the DataFrame object owns its tools. These built in tools are called **{term}`methods <Method>`**. Instead of passing the DataFrame into a function, you ask the DataFrame to perform an action on itself using **{term}`dot notation <Dot notation>`**.

:alt: Diagram comparing procedural programming syntax with object oriented dot notation.
:width: 600px
:align: center

*Mental shift: Procedural programming passes data into an external tool (e.g., `function(data)`). Object Oriented programming asks the data to use its own internal tool (e.g., `data.method()`).*

:::

For example, to get a technical summary of your data, you use the `.info()` {term}`method`:

```{code-cell} python
data.info()

```

:::{table} Output of data.info() method
:label: df-info-table
:align: center

| Column | Non-Null Count | Dtype |
| --- | --- | --- |
| City | 4 non-null | object |
| Population | 4 non-null | int64 |

:::

You are effectively telling Python: *"Hey `data` object, run your own internal `info()` tool."* This mental shift, typing `df.info()` instead of `info(df)`, is the core to mastering Pandas.

## 3. The Pandas Index

If you look at the printed DataFrame from the first section, you will notice a column of numbers on the far left (0, 1, 2, 3) that we did not create. This is the **{term}`Index`**.

In standard Python lists, positions are strictly sequential integers (0, 1, 2). While a Pandas DataFrame also defaults to a numbered index, its index is actually a set of row labels.

```{admonition} What is the index?
:class: important

The Index is **not** a standard column! It is the metadata that labels the rows. You cannot use standard column operations on the Index unless you reset it back into a normal column.

```

:::{figure} images/03_index_vs_columns.png
:alt: Diagram highlighting the difference between the Index row labels and standard Columns in a Pandas DataFrame.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*The anatomy of a DataFrame: The Index provides row labels (vertical), while the Columns hold the actual data features (horizontal).*
:::

The index does not have to be a simple sequence of numbers. You can assign names, dates, or unique IDs as the index.

```{code-cell} python
# Setting a custom text index instead of numbers
data = data.set_index("City")
print(data)

```

:::{table} Output of data after setting a custom Index
:label: df-index-table
:align: center

| City (Index) | Population |
| --- | --- |
| Zurich | 415000 |
| Geneva | 201000 |
| Bern | 133000 |
| Basel | 177000 |

:::

By labeling rows, Pandas allows you to instantly extract data based on meaningful identifiers (like extracting a row labeled "Zurich") instead of having to remember that Zurich was at position 0.

## 4. Data Types (dtypes)

When working with basic Python, you are used to **{term}`data types <Data type>`** like **{term}`integers <Integer>`** (`int`), decimal numbers (**{term}`float <Floating-point number>`**), and text **{term}`strings <String>`** (`str`).

Pandas uses slightly different terminology for its data types, referred to as **dtypes**. Because Pandas is built on top of a high performance math library called NumPy, its dtypes reflect precise computer memory allocations. As you saw in the `.info()` output table above, Pandas assigned specific dtypes to our columns:

* `int64`: A 64 bit integer (same as Python `int`).
* `float64`: A 64 bit decimal number (same as Python `float`).
* `object`: Typically represents text strings, or a mix of different types (comparable to Python `str`).
* `datetime64`: A special type strictly for dates and times.

Whenever you load a new dataset, checking the dtypes is usually your very first step to ensure numbers were not accidentally imported as text.

---

#### Concept Check: The Contaminated Column

Imagine you load a CSV file where a "Population" column accidentally contains a missing value typed out as the word `"Unknown"`, while the rest of the rows are normal numbers (e.g., `415000`). If you check the dtypes of this DataFrame, what dtype will Pandas assign to the "Population" column?

A) `int64`

B) `float64`

C) `object`

D) `datetime64`

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: C**
A single Pandas Series (column) can only have **one** overarching data type. If Pandas sees even a single text string (like "Unknown") mixed in with thousands of numbers, it must downgrade the entire column to the `object` dtype to accommodate the text. This is why checking your dtypes is so important; if a numeric column shows up as an `object`, your data requires cleaning!

```

## 5. Exercise: Mental Model Check

Let us test your new mental model. Look at the code snippet below and identify the structural components.

```python
import pandas as pd

weather_data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
average_temp = weather_data["temperature"].mean()

```

Answer the following questions:

1. What data structure is `weather_data`?
2. What data structure is `weather_data["temperature"]`?
3. If a DataFrame acts like a dictionary of Series, what are the "keys" of that dictionary?
4. Is `.mean()` a standard Python function or a Pandas method?

```{code-cell} python
# Write your code here

```

```{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

1. `weather_data` is a **DataFrame**. It is a two dimensional table loaded from the CSV file.
2. `weather_data["temperature"]` is a **Series**. Extracting a single column from a DataFrame always returns a one dimensional Series.
3. **The column names.** Just like `my_dictionary["key"]` extracts a value, `weather_data["temperature"]` uses the column name as a key to extract the entire Series.
4. `.mean()` is a **Pandas method**. Notice the dot notation: we are asking the Series object to calculate its own average.


```

## 6. Summary: The OOP Data Shift

In this chapter, you learned how to shift your mindset from procedural Python to the Object Oriented logic of Pandas.

### Key takeaways

* A **DataFrame** is a programmable table, and each column inside it is a **Series**.
* Instead of passing data into external functions, you trigger built in **methods** using dot notation.
* Every DataFrame has an **Index**, which acts as a collection of row labels rather than just sequential positions.
* Pandas uses optimized **dtypes** like `float64` and `object` instead of native Python types.

With this mental model in place, you are ready to start loading and analyzing real world datasets!
