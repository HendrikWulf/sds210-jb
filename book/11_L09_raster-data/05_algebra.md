```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

Raster bands are essentially numerical matrices. By performing mathematical operations across multiple aligned bands, we can extract entirely new environmental insights that are invisible in raw imagery.

## 1. What is Map Algebra?

In the previous chapters, you learned how to read spatial grids into memory and visualize them using cartographic techniques. Now, we transition from visualization to calculation.

**{term}`Map algebra`** is the process of performing mathematical operations pixel by pixel across one or multiple raster grids. Because Rasterio seamlessly converts geographic bands into standard **{term}`NumPy`** **{term}`arrays <Array>`**, performing map algebra in Python is identical to performing matrix mathematics. If you have two perfectly aligned arrays representing different parts of the light spectrum, you can add, subtract, multiply, or divide their values to generate a brand new surface. This is how you can calculate derived environmental indices, track deforestation, and map flood boundaries.

---

## 2. Calculating Indices

Raw satellite data records the amount of light reflected by the Earth. By mathematically combining specific bands, we can isolate and highlight distinct environmental features.

### The Normalized Difference Snow Index

To map snow and ice coverage, scientists use the **{term}`Normalized Difference Snow Index`** (NDSI). Snow reflects visible light very strongly (which is why it looks bright white to our eyes) but absorbs Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) light. By comparing the Green band and the SWIR band, we can easily isolate snow from clouds and bare rock.

The mathematical formula for NDSI is:

$$NDSI = \frac{Green - SWIR2}{Green + SWIR2}$$

However, calculating the raw index is only the first step. Because water also features high NDSI values (it has higher reflectance in the visible range than in the NIR and SWIR), we must exclude water bodies to prevent false positives. We do this by utilizing the NIR band. Water strongly absorbs NIR light, so we can isolate dry land and snow by only keeping pixels with NIR values greater than 0.2. Finally, to clearly separate snow and ice from everything else, we filter for NDSI values higher than 0.6 to generate a clean, binary snow map.

To calculate this in Python, we first read the Green, NIR, and SWIR2 bands into separate, perfectly aligned NumPy arrays.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc

filepath = "data/LC09_L1TP_075090_20230224_20230308_02_T1_subset.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    # Read the bands and immediately convert them to float to allow division
    # Band 2 = Green, Band 4 = NIR, Band 6 = SWIR2
    green = src.read(2).astype(float)
    nir = src.read(4).astype(float)
    swir2 = src.read(6).astype(float)

```

### Suppressing Division Warnings

When performing division across millions of pixels, you will inevitably encounter "divide by zero" or "invalid value" warnings. This occurs because the background areas outside the satellite image footprint contain zeros (NoData values). Dividing zero by zero produces a warning and returns `NaN` (**{term}`NaN`**).

We can handle this cleanly using a NumPy context manager, which temporarily suppresses these expected warnings during the calculation.

```{code-cell} python
# Suppress warnings for zero division and invalid operations
with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):
    # Perform the pixel by pixel array math
    ndsi = (green - swir2) / (green + swir2)
    
    # Exclude water (requires NIR > 0.2) and filter for high NDSI (> 0.6)
    snow = (ndsi * (nir > 0.2)) > 0.6

# Plot the calculated index
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.imshow(snow, cmap=cmc.batlowW, vmin=0, vmax=1)
plt.title("Snow & Ice Map (NDSI > 0.6)")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: A binary snow mask. By chaining NumPy operations, we excluded water and isolated snow pixels from all other land surfaces.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

While the raw NDSI calculation yields a continuous array ranging from -1 to 1 (where values closer to 1 represent confident snow cover), our conditional filters converted this into a binary mask. The final `snow` map contains only values of `0` (no snow/ice) and `1` (snow/ice), which makes it incredibly easy to quantify the total snow-covered area in subsequent analyses.

#### Concept Check: The Division Dilemma

**Scenario:** When calculating a spectral index like the NDSI across millions of pixels, you wrap your mathematical formula inside `with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):`. What is the primary purpose of this context manager?

A) To automatically delete any pixels that contain clouds or shadows from the dataset.

B) To prevent Python from filling the console with warnings or crashing when the formula inevitably attempts to divide by zero in the empty (NoData) background areas of the raster.

C) To mathematically force all negative index values to become positive numbers.

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B**
Satellite images are rectangular arrays, but the Earth data inside them is often irregularly shaped, leaving borders filled with `0` or NoData. Since index formulas use division, dividing by these zero-filled background areas throws errors. Suppressing these specific warnings keeps your console clean without altering the valid math happening in the rest of the array.

```

## 3. Change Detection

Map algebra is not limited to combining bands from a single image. If you have two rasters representing the exact same location at different times, you can subtract one from the other to calculate environmental change.

Let us look at an example of deforestation in Indonesia using Landsat 8 data from 2019 and 2023.

The **{term}`Enhanced Vegetation Index`** (EVI) is heavily used to monitor biomass and canopy structure. The formula is slightly more complex than simple normalized differences:

$$EVI = 2.5 \times \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + 6 \times Red - 7.5 \times Blue + 1}$$

To detect deforestation, we calculate the EVI for the older image, calculate the EVI for the newer image, and subtract the two. To verify that our math aligns with reality, it is highly useful to visualize this calculated EVI change alongside **{term}`False Color Composites <False color composite>`** (FCCs) of the original dates.

Assuming we have already loaded our arrays and calculated the `evi_change`, we can build a three-panel comparison plot.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc

def calculate_evi(blue, red, nir):
    """Calculates EVI from float arrays."""
    with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):
        evi = 2.5 * ((nir - red) / (nir + 6 * red - 7.5 * blue + 1))
    return evi

def normalize(array, vmin=0.05, vmax=0.4):
    """Normalize and clip array to a specific range to stretch contrast."""
    clipped = np.clip(array, vmin, vmax)
    return (clipped - vmin) / (vmax - vmin)

# Prepare data for 2019
with rasterio.open("data/LC08_121061_20190904_subset.tif") as src:
    blue19 = src.read(1).astype(float)
    red19 = src.read(3).astype(float)
    nir19 = src.read(4).astype(float)
    swir2_19 = src.read(6).astype(float)
    
    fcc_19 = np.dstack((
        normalize(swir2_19, vmax=0.25),
        normalize(nir19, vmax=0.4),
        normalize(red19, vmax=0.2)
    ))

# Prepare data for 2023
with rasterio.open("data/LC08_121061_20230814_subset.tif") as src:
    blue23 = src.read(1).astype(float)
    red23 = src.read(3).astype(float)
    nir23 = src.read(4).astype(float)
    swir2_23 = src.read(6).astype(float)
    
    fcc_23 = np.dstack((
        normalize(swir2_23, vmax=0.25),
        normalize(nir23, vmax=0.4),
        normalize(red23, vmax=0.2)
    ))

# Map Algebra: Calculate EVI and determine the difference
evi_2019 = calculate_evi(blue19, red19, nir19)
evi_2023 = calculate_evi(blue23, red23, nir23)
evi_change = evi_2023 - evi_2019

# Create the 1x3 subplot comparison
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(20, 7))

# Plot 2019 FCC
axes[0].imshow(fcc_19)
axes[0].set_title("2019 FCC (SWIR2, NIR, Red)", fontsize=18)
axes[0].axis('off')

# Plot 2023 FCC
axes[1].imshow(fcc_23)
axes[1].set_title("2023 FCC (SWIR2, NIR, Red)", fontsize=18)
axes[1].axis('off')

# Plot EVI Change using a diverging colormap
im = axes[2].imshow(evi_change, cmap=cmc.bam, vmin=-0.5, vmax=0.5)
axes[2].set_title("EVI Change (2019 to 2023)", fontsize=18)
axes[2].axis('off')

# Add a colorbar for the EVI change plot
cbar = fig.colorbar(im, ax=axes[2], fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)
cbar.set_label("Change in Vegetation", fontsize=16)
cbar.ax.tick_params(labelsize=16)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

    Output: By comparing the 2019 and 2023 False Color Composites, we can visually spot the expansion of bare land. The EVI change map quantifies this exactly, using the diverging `bam` colormap to highlight regions of severe vegetation loss in dark red.

### Calculating Spectral Distance

While examining a specific index like EVI is highly useful for targeting vegetation, sometimes you want to know the total overall change across the entire spectrum. To do this, we calculate the **{term}`Euclidean distance`** between the spectral signatures of the two dates across all available bands.

$$Distance = \sqrt{(Blue_{new} - Blue_{old})^2 + (Green_{new} - Green_{old})^2 + \dots}$$

This calculation treats each pixel's spectral signature as a point in multidimensional space and measures exactly how far that point has moved between 2019 and 2023.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc

# 1. Read and define all relevant bands for 2019
with rasterio.open("data/LC08_121061_20190904_subset.tif") as src:
    blue19 = src.read(1).astype(float)
    green19 = src.read(2).astype(float)
    red19 = src.read(3).astype(float)
    nir19 = src.read(4).astype(float)
    swir1_19 = src.read(5).astype(float)
    swir2_19 = src.read(6).astype(float)

# 2. Read and define all relevant bands for 2023
with rasterio.open("data/LC08_121061_20230814_subset.tif") as src:
    blue23 = src.read(1).astype(float)
    green23 = src.read(2).astype(float)
    red23 = src.read(3).astype(float)
    nir23 = src.read(4).astype(float)
    swir1_23 = src.read(5).astype(float)
    swir2_23 = src.read(6).astype(float)

# 3. Extend the spectral distance formula to include all bands
spectral_distance = np.sqrt(
    (blue23 - blue19)**2 +
    (green23 - green19)**2 +
    (red23 - red19)**2 +
    (nir23 - nir19)**2 +
    (swir1_23 - swir1_19)**2 +
    (swir2_23 - swir2_19)**2
)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
# Clip the colormap to the 98th percentile to prevent extreme outliers from washing out the image
plt.imshow(spectral_distance, cmap=cmc.lajolla, vmin=0, vmax=np.nanpercentile(spectral_distance, 98)) 
plt.title("Total Spectral Distance")
plt.colorbar(label="Magnitude of Change")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: Total Spectral Distance using the sequential `lajolla` colormap. Bright areas represent pixels that have drastically shifted their reflectance signature, serving as a universal mask for land surface change.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

Spectral distance serves as a powerful general change mask, highlighting any pixel that looks fundamentally different today than it did in the past, regardless of whether that change was driven by deforestation, urbanization, or flooding.

## 4. Exercise: The Water Index

In this exercise, you will apply map algebra to map a major flood event related to the filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).

You are provided with two 3 band composite images: `GERD_before_composite_SWIR1_NIR_Green.tif` and `GERD_after_composite_SWIR1_NIR_Green.tif`. The filenames indicate the band order. Band 1 is Shortwave Infrared (SWIR1), Band 2 is Near Infrared (NIR), and Band 3 is Green.

**Tasks:**

1. Open both datasets and read the Green and NIR bands as float arrays.
2. Calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for both the "before" and "after" periods. The formula is:

$$NDWI = \frac{Green - NIR}{Green + NIR}$$

3. Calculate the NDWI difference by subtracting the "before" array from the "after" array.
4. Create a binary flood mask. A pixel represents new water (a flood) if the NDWI difference is greater than `0.2`.
5. To visually verify your math, generate False Color Composites (using the SWIR1, NIR, and Green bands) for both time periods. Plot these alongside your binary flood mask in a three panel side by side comparison.

## 5. Summary: Raster Math

Map algebra relies on the fundamental connection between spatial layers and NumPy matrices. By mastering these operations, you unlock the ability to generate completely new data from raw imagery.

* **Pixel-by-Pixel Mathematics:** When spatial datasets share the same extent and resolution, you can apply basic arithmetic operators directly across their arrays.
* **Derived Indices:** Formulas like NDSI, EVI, and NDWI combine different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum to isolate specific environmental variables like snow, biomass, and water.
* **Warning Management:** Always convert raw integer data to floats before division, and use `np.errstate` to suppress unavoidable NoData division warnings.
* **Temporal Change Detection:** Subtracting indices from two different time periods reveals precise geographic patterns of loss and gain.
* **Spectral Distance:** Calculating the Euclidean distance across multiple bands provides a robust, index-agnostic measure of overall environmental change.
