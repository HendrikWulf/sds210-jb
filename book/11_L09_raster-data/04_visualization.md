```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

Raster visualization is never just about showing pixels. Every plot is a choice about how numerical values are translated into visual meaning.

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★★ (A critical bottleneck; absolutely required for plotting False Color Composites and adjusting `vmin`/`vmax` based on histograms in Part 2 and Part 5)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★★ (Required for accurately presenting satellite imagery and communicating visual, analytical results in projects 3 and 4)  
**Foundation:** ★★☆ (Key visualization skills specific to multi-band imagery and continuous environmental surfaces)  

**Time to Read:** 20 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Transform raw numerical arrays into meaningful geographic maps using perceptually uniform colormaps, histograms, RGB composites, and 3D hillshades.  
**Skip this if:** You are fully proficient in plotting raster arrays using `rasterio.plot.show`, generating scaled RGB False Color Composites, and interpreting raster histograms for contrast stretching.

```

In the previous chapter, you used `rasterio.plot.show()` for quick visual feedback after opening a raster. That was an important first step. But a quick preview is not yet the same as a good visualization.

In this chapter, you will learn how to visualize raster data more deliberately. You will work with single band rasters such as elevation models, multi band rasters such as satellite imagery, and derived visualizations such as RGB composites and hillshades. Along the way, you will see that the same raster can reveal very different patterns depending on how you choose to display it.

```{admonition} Data Preparation
:class: dropdown

To follow along with this chapter, place the following datasets in a `data` folder next to your notebook: 

* [Copernicus DEM New Zealand (Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif)](https://gitlab.com/HendrikWulf/sds210/-/blob/main/L09/data/Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif)
* [Landsat 9 Multispectral Subset (LC09_L1TP_075090_20230224_20230308_02_T1_subset.tif)](https://gitlab.com/HendrikWulf/sds210/-/blob/main/L09/data/LC09_L1TP_075090_20230224_20230308_02_T1_subset.tif)
* [GLIMS Glaciers New Zealand (GLIMS_glaciers_NZ_subset.zip)](https://gitlab.com/HendrikWulf/sds210/-/blob/main/L09/data/GLIMS_glaciers_NZ_subset.zip)
* [ETOPO1 Topography & Bathymetry (ETOPO1_bedrock_subset_2000m_3857.tif)](https://gitlab.com/HendrikWulf/sds210/-/blob/main/L09/data/ETOPO1_bedrock_subset_2000m_3857.tif)

```

## 1. The `show()` Must Go On

When you first open a raster, a quick preview is often enough to answer a few fundamental questions:

* Did the file load correctly?
* Does the spatial extent look plausible?
* Are there obvious missing areas or strange artifacts?

Rasterio makes this initial check incredibly easy with the `show()` function.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show

filepath = "data/Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    show(src, title="New Zealand Elevation DEM", cmap="terrain")

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: The <code>show()</code> function provides immediate visual feedback, rendering the array correctly in geographic space using the dataset's attached metadata.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

This kind of preview is very useful. But once you move beyond a simple data check, new analytical questions appear:

* Which colormap makes the most scientific sense for this specific variable?
* Should I display one band, or combine several into a composite?
* Do I want to emphasize absolute elevation, vegetation health, or surface texture?
* Would plotting a histogram first help me understand the distribution of values?

From this point onward, visualization ceases to be just a preview, it becomes an integral part of the analysis itself.

```{admonition} A useful habit
:class: note

Start with a quick preview to verify your data. Then, slow down and deliberately construct a visualization that matches the exact scientific question you want to answer.

```

## 2. Visualizing Single Band Rasters

Many rasters contain only one band. A **{term}`Digital elevation model`** (DEM) is a prime example. In a single band raster, each grid cell stores exactly one value representing one continuous variable.

### One band, one surface

A single band raster is best understood as a continuous surface of measurements. Depending on the dataset, that surface might represent elevation, temperature, precipitation, spectral indices (like NDVI), or slope.

The simplest way to visualize such a raster is to read the band into a standard **{term}`NumPy`** **{term}`array <Array>`** and display it using **{term}`Matplotlib`**.

```{code-cell} python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with rasterio.open("data/Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif") as src:
    dem = src.read(1)

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 6))
plt.imshow(dem, cmap="viridis")
plt.title("DEM as a NumPy array (Viridis)")
plt.colorbar(label="Elevation (m)")
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: Visualizing the raw array using <code>plt.imshow()</code>. Notice that the axes display row and column indices rather than real-world coordinates.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

This works for looking at the data grid, but notice the critical difference from `show()`: `plt.imshow()` treats the array purely as an image, placing raw row and column indices on the axes. To create a true cartographic map, we must reintroduce the raster's spatial metadata manually.

### Visualization with spatial context

As we discussed in the previous lesson on cartographic design, your choice of **{term}`colormap <Colormap>`** drastically affects how data is interpreted. Because elevation is a continuous variable progressing from low to high, a sequential, **{term}`perceptually uniform <Perceptually uniform colormap>`** colormap is essential to prevent visual distortion. Instead of standard defaults like `viridis`, we will use the `batlowW` colormap from the `cmcrameri` package for scientific accuracy.

To upgrade our visualization from a raw grid to a more professional map, we must also manually apply the spatial metadata and refine the cartography. This involves projecting the boundaries, anchoring our color scale, and cleaning up the axes:

* **Projecting boundaries (`transform_bounds`, `extent`):** To display real-world coordinates instead of array indices, we extract the dataset's bounding box (`src.bounds`) and transform it into our desired **{term}`Coordinate Reference System`** (here, `EPSG:2193` for the New Zealand Transverse Mercator). We then pass these coordinates to `imshow` via the `extent` argument.
* **Anchoring the colormap (`vmin`, `vmax`):** We explicitly set `vmin=0` and `vmax=3000`. This ensures the color scale remains fixed and comparable across different maps, rather than arbitrarily stretching to the local minimum and maximum of this specific subset.
* **Formatting aesthetics (`MaxNLocator`):** We apply proper "Northing" and "Easting" labels, adjust global font sizes for readability, and use `MaxNLocator` to strictly limit the number of axis ticks, reducing visual clutter.

```{code-cell} python
# Install the scientific colormap package if necessary
# !pip install cmcrameri

import rasterio
from rasterio.warp import transform_bounds
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker

filepath = "data/Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    left, bottom, right, top = src.bounds
    geo_bounds = transform_bounds(src.crs, 'EPSG:2193', left, bottom, right, top)
    dem_data = src.read(1)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Adjust global font sizes for clear reading
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14})

# Plot the array with strict color limits and true spatial extents
img = ax.imshow(dem_data, cmap=cmc.batlowW, vmin=0, vmax=3000,
                extent=[geo_bounds[0], geo_bounds[2], geo_bounds[1], geo_bounds[3]])

# Set descriptive labels with specific font sizes and padding
ax.set_title("DEM in NZTM 2000", fontsize=16, pad=16)
ax.set_xlabel("Easting", fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel("Northing", fontsize=14)

# Reduce the number of ticks to prevent overlapping labels
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=2))
ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=2))

# Format the colorbar
cbar = fig.colorbar(img, label="Elevation (m)")
cbar.ax.tick_params(labelsize=14)

plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: A deliberate, publication-ready visualization. The spatial extent is mapped to real-world coordinates, the axes are clean and labeled, and the perceptually uniform colormap honestly represents the terrain's continuous elevation.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

## 3. Multi Band Rasters

Satellite images often contain multiple bands. These are not simply different colors. They are measurements of reflected or emitted energy in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

A typical multispectral raster may include bands such as: Blue, Green, Red, Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared, and Thermal Infrared.

### What a band represents

Each band is its own raster layer. That means a multispectral image is really a stack of perfectly aligned single band rasters. You can check how many bands a raster contains using the `.count` attribute:

```{code-cell} python
filepath = "data/LC09_L1TP_075090_20230224_20230308_02_T1_subset.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    print("Band count:", src.count)

```

### Looking at bands separately

A good way to begin exploring satellite imagery is to visualize the bands one by one. In this example, we will look at the visible light spectrum: Band 3 (Red), Band 2 (Green), and Band 1 (Blue).

```{code-cell} python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from rasterio.plot import show

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(11, 4), sharey=True)

    show((src, 3), cmap="viridis", ax=ax1)
    show((src, 4), cmap="viridis", ax=ax2)
    show((src, 6), cmap="viridis", ax=ax3)

    ax1.set_title("Band 3 (Red)")
    ax2.set_title("Band 4 (NIR)")
    ax3.set_title("Band 6 (SWIR2)")

plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: Visualizing selected sprectral bands separately. Different environmental surfaces (like water, forests, and snow) reflect light differently across the spectrum, which is why the patterns vary between the Red, NIR, and SWIR2 bands.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Histograms of raster values

Before building more complex visualizations, it is highly useful to inspect the distribution of your data to understand the underlying values.

For instance, Band 7 in our Landsat dataset represents Thermal Infrared (TIR), which measures surface temperature. By plotting a **{term}`histogram <Histogram>`**, we can observe the temperature distribution in Kelvin.

```{code-cell} python
from rasterio.plot import show_hist

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))

    # Explicitly pass the ax object and set the label for the legend
    show_hist(
        (src, 7),
        bins=100,
        range=(265, 305),
        lw=0.0,
        stacked=False,
        alpha=1,
        histtype="stepfilled",
        title="Histogram of TIR1",
        ax=ax,
        label="Band 7"
    )

    # Modify the axes to reflect the physical units (Kelvin)
    ax.set_xlabel("Temperature (Kelvin)")
    ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")
    ax.legend()  # Display the legend with the custom label

plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: The histogram reveals the distribution of surface temperatures across the image. Most of the values are clustered between 270 K and 295 K.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

Histograms help answer critical analytical questions: Are the values tightly clustered or widely spread? Do some bands have very different ranges? Would adjusting the minimum and maximum values (`vmin` and `vmax`) help us stretch the contrast before displaying the image?

``````{admonition} Visualizing and Scaling Multiple Bands
:class: dropdown

When working with data beyond the visible spectrum, comparing spatial patterns alongside their statistical distributions is incredibly helpful. In the code below, we create a 2x3 grid to analyze three non-visible bands: Near Infrared (B4), Shortwave Infrared (B6), and Thermal Infrared (B7).

* **Top Row (Spatial Plots):** We use the `plasma` colormap and apply custom `vmin` and `vmax` limits. These limits artificially "stretch" the color scale to match the specific data ranges of each band, enhancing the contrast.
* **Bottom Row (Histograms):** We plot the data distribution for each band. Looking at these histograms helps us determine exactly where to set the `vmin` and `vmax` thresholds in the top row!
* **Formatting:** We use Matplotlib's `ticker` to clean up the coordinate axes and force the histograms into a square aspect ratio for a clean, publication-ready layout.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show, show_hist
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker

filepath = "data/LC09_L1TP_075090_20230224_20230308_02_T1_subset.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    # Create a 2x3 grid of subplots
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=3, figsize=(15, 10))

    # Top row: Spatial plots with custom scaling (vmin/vmax)
    show((src, 4), cmap="plasma", ax=axes[0, 0], vmin=0, vmax=0.5)
    axes[0, 0].set_title("Band 4 (NIR)")

    show((src, 6), cmap="plasma", ax=axes[0, 1], vmin=0, vmax=0.3)
    axes[0, 1].set_title("Band 6 (SWIR2)")

    show((src, 7), cmap="plasma", ax=axes[0, 2], vmin=0.2, vmax=0.8)
    axes[0, 2].set_title("Band 7 (TIR1)")

    # Bottom row: Histograms showing the distribution of values
    show_hist((src, 4), bins=100, range=(0, 1), ax=axes[1, 0],
              lw=0.0, stacked=False, histtype='stepfilled', title="Histogram B4")

    show_hist((src, 6), bins=100, range=(0, 1), ax=axes[1, 1],
              lw=0.0, stacked=False, histtype='stepfilled', title="Histogram B6")

    show_hist((src, 7), bins=100, range=(260, 310), ax=axes[1, 2],
              lw=0.0, stacked=False, histtype='stepfilled', title="Histogram B7")

    # Clean up formatting across all columns
    for i in range(3):
        # Limit spatial plot ticks to reduce clutter
        axes[0, i].xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=2))
        axes[0, i].yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=2))

        # Make histogram axes square to match the spatial plots above them
        axes[1, i].set_box_aspect(1)

        # Remove default legends from histograms
        if axes[1, i].get_legend():
            axes[1, i].get_legend().remove()

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

## 4. Building Color Composites

A multiband raster does not automatically appear as a natural color photograph. To create that kind of view, you must combine selected bands into an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) composite.

A **{term}`True color composite`** mimics human vision by combining:

* Red into the red channel
* Green into the green channel
* Blue into the blue channel

Raw satellite data often contains a wide range of values, which can cause the image to look dark or washed out if displayed directly. Before stacking these bands into a single image, it is highly useful to apply a **contrast stretch**. By clipping the extreme values and normalizing the remaining data to a comparable scale (0 to 1), we can dramatically brighten the image and reveal hidden features.

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import rasterio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

filepath = "data/LC09_L1TP_075090_20230224_20230308_02_T1_subset.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    red = src.read(3)
    green = src.read(2)
    blue = src.read(1)

def normalize(array, vmin=0, vmax=0.4):
    """Normalize and clip array to a specific range (default 0 to 0.4)"""
    # Clip the array to the specified vmin and vmax
    clipped = np.clip(array, vmin, vmax)
    # Scale the clipped array to 0-1 for display
    return (clipped - vmin) / (vmax - vmin)

red_n = normalize(red)
green_n = normalize(green)
blue_n = normalize(blue)

# Stack the normalized bands along a third dimension
rgb = np.dstack((red_n, green_n, blue_n))

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 6))
plt.imshow(rgb)
plt.title("RGB true color composite (Scaled 0-0.4)")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: An RGB true color composite. By applying a contrast stretch (clipping the values at 0.4), the landscape features are brightened and clearly visible.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

This image looks much more like a photograph because the visible light bands have been explicitly assigned to their matching visual color channels, and the data has been stretched for optimal viewing.

### False color composites

Sometimes, realism is not the goal. A **{term}`false color composite`** highlights environmental features that are otherwise hard to distinguish.

A common analytical composite maps Shortwave Infrared (SWIR2) to the red channel, Near Infrared (NIR) to the green channel, and Red to the blue channel. Because healthy vegetation reflects heavily in the NIR spectrum, forested areas stand out vividly in bright green, while variations in bare earth are highlighted by the SWIR band.

```{code-cell} python
with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    swir2 = src.read(6)
    nir = src.read(4)
    red = src.read(3)

# Normalize the bands using the same function defined earlier
swir2_n = normalize(swir2)
nir_n = normalize(nir)
red_n = normalize(red)

fcc = np.dstack((swir2_n, nir_n, red_n))

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 6))
plt.imshow(fcc)
plt.title("False color composite (SWIR2, NIR, Red)")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: A SWIR2-NIR-Red false color composite. Vegetation reflects highly in Near Infrared (mapped to Green), making it stand out vividly against soil and water.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

```{admonition} A key point
:class: note

A raster visualisation does not necessarily imitate human vision. Often, the aim is to increase the separability between different land cover types. Contrast stretching plays an important role in this process by increasing contrast and enhancing image detail.

```

## 5. Terrain Visualization with Hillshades

Elevation rasters are often much more readable when we step beyond a simple color ramp. A DEM stores raw elevation values, but those values alone do not always reveal structural features like valleys, ridges, and subtle slopes clearly.

### Hillshade

A **{term}`Hillshade`** simulates how light from the sun would fall across a terrain surface, casting highlights and shadows. It does not change the actual elevation values; rather, it creates a brand new raster representing hypothetical illumination based on the slope and aspect of the terrain.

You can calculate a simple hillshade directly from a NumPy array by defining the sun's azimuth (compass direction) and angle of altitude (height in the sky). Adjusting these parameters drastically alters how the topography is perceived.

To help visualize flat landscapes, we can also introduce a **Z-factor** (vertical exaggeration). This artificially multiplies the elevation differences, making subtle topographic features much more prominent.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->

</iframe>

<figcaption>
    <em><b>Interactive Explorer: Hillshade Simulator.</b><br>
    Use the sliders to adjust the Sun's position and the terrain's vertical exaggeration. Notice how lower altitudes stretch the shadows, and how increasing the Z-Factor makes subtle features pop out dramatically.

</figcaption>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033-->

Here is how you can calculate this hillshade programmatically in Python.

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
import rasterio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def hillshade(array, azimuth, angle_altitude, z_factor=1):
    """Calculates a simulated hillshade from an elevation array."""
    azimuth = 360.0 - azimuth

    # Apply vertical exaggeration (z_factor) to the gradients
    x, y = np.gradient(array * z_factor)
    slope = np.pi / 2.0 - np.arctan(np.sqrt(x * x + y * y))
    aspect = np.arctan2(-x, y)
    azm_rad = np.radians(azimuth)
    alt_rad = np.radians(angle_altitude)

    shaded = (
        np.sin(alt_rad) * np.sin(slope)
        + np.cos(alt_rad) * np.cos(slope) * np.cos((azm_rad - np.pi / 2.0) - aspect)
    )

    return 255 * (shaded + 1) / 2

```

Notice that when we plot the result, we use `np.percentile` to dynamically set our `vmin` and `vmax`. This stretches the contrast by ignoring the extreme 2% of outliers, resulting in a much crisper image.

```{code-cell} python
with rasterio.open("data/Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif") as src:
    dem = src.read(1)

# Increase z_factor for better contrast in relief
hs = hillshade(dem, azimuth=315, angle_altitude=45, z_factor=2)

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 6))
# Use 'gray' cmap and adjust contrast by clipping the 2nd and 98th percentiles
plt.imshow(hs, cmap="gray", vmin=np.percentile(hs, 2), vmax=np.percentile(hs, 98))
plt.title("Hillshade (Z-factor=2)")
plt.colorbar(label="Illumination")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: A simulated hillshade. The Z-factor of 2 artificially steepens the slopes, making the ridges and valleys stand out sharply in the grayscale colormap.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Multidirectional Hillshade

In a standard hillshade, a single light source can leave slopes facing away from the sun in complete, flat darkness, hiding the terrain structure there. A multidirectional hillshade solves this by calculating illumination from several different angles and averaging them together. This ensures surface texture remains visible everywhere, even in the shadows.

```{code-cell} python
def multidirectional_hillshade(array, angle_altitude=45, z_factor=1):
    """Calculates an averaged hillshade from multiple azimuths."""
    # Define five distinct azimuths to simulate ambient environmental light
    azimuths = [225, 270, 315, 360, 45]
    hillshades = []

    for az in azimuths:
        hs = hillshade(array, az, angle_altitude, z_factor)
        hillshades.append(hs)

    # Average the individual hillshades for a multidirectional effect
    return np.mean(hillshades, axis=0)

# Compute and plot
multi_hs = multidirectional_hillshade(dem, angle_altitude=45, z_factor=1)

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 6))
plt.imshow(multi_hs, cmap="gray", alpha=0.5, vmin=np.percentile(multi_hs, 2), vmax=np.percentile(multi_hs, 68))
plt.title("Multidirectional Hillshade")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: A multidirectional hillshade. By averaging light from multiple angles, deep shadows are filled in, revealing the underlying topography across the entire landscape.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Hillshade overlay

While a hillshade reveals surface texture brilliantly, it strips away the absolute elevation data. A common and highly effective cartographic technique is to place a semi-transparent hillshade directly over a colored DEM.

By utilizing the `alpha` parameter, we can control the transparency of the hillshade layer, allowing the underlying elevation colors to shine through the shadows.

```{code-cell} python
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc

hs = hillshade(dem, azimuth=315, angle_altitude=45)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Base layer: Colored DEM
im1 = ax.imshow(dem, cmap=cmc.batlowW, vmin=0, vmax=3000)
fig.colorbar(im1, ax=ax, label="Elevation (m)")

# Overlay layer: Hillshade with transparency (alpha)
ax.imshow(hs, cmap="Greys", alpha=0.35)
ax.set_title("DEM with hillshade overlay")
ax.axis('off')
plt.show()

```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033-->
<div class="figure-caption-like">
    Output: An alpha overlay. The sequential colormap carries the absolute elevation values, while the semi-transparent hillshade provides intuitive 3D structure.
</div>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Hillshade blending

Instead of manually calculating the hillshade and overlaying it with transparency, Matplotlib provides a built-in `LightSource` class that handles both the shading and the blending natively.

Different blending modes (`hsv`, `overlay`, or `soft`) combine the hillshade and the colormap using different mathematical algorithms. This native blending often produces a more vibrant and integrated map than a simple alpha overlay.

```{code-cell} python
from matplotlib.colors import LightSource

# Define parameters: Focus only on VE=1 (Vertical Exaggeration)
ve = 1

## 6. Raster Maps with Vector Data

Raster maps are often much easier to interpret when combined with vector boundary data to provide real-world context. A vector boundary, study area outline, or glacier polygon anchors the abstract raster grid in geographic reality.

When combining these two data types using Matplotlib and GeoPandas, you must address two critical spatial rules:

1. **The Alignment Problem (`extent`):** By default, `plt.imshow()` plots a NumPy array using row and column indices (e.g., 0 to 1000). GeoPandas, however, plots geometries using real-world spatial coordinates. If you plot them together without adjustment, they will completely miss each other. To fix this, you must explicitly pass the raster's bounding box to `imshow` using the `extent` argument.
2. **The CRS Rule (`to_crs`):** As always, both layers must share the exact same Coordinate Reference System (CRS). We can dynamically project the vector layer to match the raster's CRS before plotting.

In the example below, we will use the multidirectional hillshade from the previous section as our base map and overlay a **{term}`GeoDataFrame`** containing glacier boundaries.

```{code-cell} python
import geopandas as gpd
import rasterio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker

# Load the vector data (glacier outlines)
vector_path = "data/GLIMS_glaciers_NZ_subset.zip"
gdf = gpd.read_file(vector_path)

# Load the raster data and extract spatial metadata
with rasterio.open("data/Copernicus_DEM_NZ_subset.tif") as src:
    dem = src.read(1)
    src_crs = src.crs
    src_bounds = src.bounds

# Calculate the multidirectional hillshade (reusing the function from earlier)
multi_hs = multidirectional_hillshade(dem, angle_altitude=45, z_factor=1)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Plot the raster. 
# CRITICAL: We set the 'extent' so it plots in spatial coordinates, not pixel indices!
img = ax.imshow(multi_hs, cmap="gray", alpha=0.5, 
                vmin=np.percentile(multi_hs, 2), 
                vmax=np.percentile(multi_hs, 68),
                extent=[src_bounds.left, src_bounds.right, src_bounds.bottom, src_bounds.top])

# Project the vector data to match the raster's CRS, then plot on top
gdf = gdf.to_crs(src_crs)
gdf.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor="lightblue", facecolor="cyan", alpha=0.7, lw=1)

# Clean up axes for a professional cartographic display
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=3))
ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(ticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=4))

# Set labels with specific font sizes
ax.set_title("Glacier Extent Overlay on Hillshade", fontsize=16, pad=16)
ax.set_xlabel("Easting", fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel("Northing", fontsize=14)

plt.show()

```

#### Concept Check: The Floating Polygons

**Scenario:** You have a raster of rainfall (`rain_array`) and a GeoDataFrame of city boundaries (`cities_gdf`). Both share the exact same Coordinate Reference System (EPSG:3857). You plot them together using:

```python
ax.imshow(rain_array)
cities_gdf.plot(ax=ax)

```

When the map renders, the rain raster is tiny and stuck in the bottom left corner, while the city polygons are floating millions of units away. What went wrong?

A) `imshow()` plotted the raster using raw row/column pixel indices (e.g., 0 to 1000) instead of real-world coordinates because the `extent` argument was missing.

B) The city polygons need to be converted into a NumPy array before plotting.

C) The raster array needs to be mathematically transposed using `np.transpose()` to align with the vector data.

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: A**
Unlike `GeoDataFrame.plot()`, which natively understands spatial coordinates, Matplotlib's `imshow()` treats NumPy arrays as simple images and plots them using their raw index numbers. To bridge this gap, you must explicitly pass the raster's physical bounding box to `imshow` using the `extent` argument!

```

## 7. Exercise: Visualizing Bathymetry

In this final exercise, you will apply your knowledge of scientific colormaps and hillshade blending to a global dataset.

You are given a subset of the ETOPO1 dataset (`data/ETOPO1_bedrock_subset_2000m_3857.tif`), which contains continuous elevation data for the entire globe. Positive values represent land topography, while negative values represent ocean bathymetry.

**Tasks:**

1. Open the raster and read the elevation band into a NumPy array.
2. Use Matplotlib's `LightSource` to create a blended visualization.
3. Apply the `cmc.oleron` colormap. This is a multi-sequential colormap specifically designed for elevation data that crosses the sea-level boundary.
4. Set `vmin` and `vmax` so that `0` (sea level) aligns with the colormap's natural transition point.
5. Pass the pixel resolution (`dx=2000`, `dy=2000`) into the `shade()` function so the algorithm accurately calculates the real-world slopes for the shadows.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LightSource
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc

filepath = "data/ETOPO1_bedrock_subset_2000m_3857.tif"

# Write your code here


```

``````{admonition} Sample Solution
:class: dropdown

Notice that we use `blend_mode="overlay"` to balance the vivid colors of the `oleron` colormap with the structural shadows. We also apply a vertical exaggeration (`vert_exag=10`) because global-scale features often appear entirely flat without it.

```{code-cell} python
import rasterio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LightSource
import cmcrameri.cm as cmc

filepath = "data/ETOPO1_bedrock_subset_2000m_3857.tif"

with rasterio.open(filepath) as src:
    dem = src.read(1)

# Use LightSource to blend terrain colors with hillshade in 'overlay' mode
ls = LightSource(azdeg=315, altdeg=45)

rgb = ls.shade(
    dem,
    cmap=cmc.oleron,
    blend_mode="overlay",
    vert_exag=10,
    vmin=-5000, 
    vmax=5000,
    dx=2000,
    dy=2000
)

# Plot result
plt.figure(figsize=(11, 6))
plt.imshow(rgb)
plt.title("ETOPO1 Topography & Bathymetry (Hillshade Blend)", fontsize=14, pad=12)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

:::{figure} images/18_etopo1_oleron_hillshade.png
:alt: A global map of Earth's topography and bathymetry using the oleron colormap, where oceans transition from deep blue to light green, and landmasses transition from green to brown and white, all textured with crisp 3D hillshading.

*Output: A professional, publication-ready global elevation map. The `oleron` colormap beautifully distinguishes the ocean floor from the continents, while the `LightSource` blending adds intuitive 3D texture to the mountain ranges and oceanic trenches.*

## 8. Summary

Raster values do not speak for themselves. Visualization is the deliberate process of translating raw numerical grids into interpretable spatial patterns. In this chapter, you learned how to:

* **Apply spatial context and scientific colormaps:** Anchor NumPy arrays to real-world coordinates and use perceptually uniform colormaps (like `batlow`) for accurate data representation.
* **Stretch data distributions:** Use histograms to analyze pixel values and adjust `vmin` and `vmax` to enhance visual contrast.
* **Build spectral composites:** Stack multi-band satellite imagery into true and false color composites to highlight specific environmental features.
* **Reveal topography:** Calculate hillshades and blend them with elevation data to create intuitive 3D terrain models.
* **Unify raster and vector data:** Combine continuous grids with discrete vector boundaries using a shared Coordinate Reference System (CRS).

Now that you can safely read and professionally visualize these arrays, it is time to start crunching the numbers. In the next chapter, we introduce **{term}`map algebra <Map algebra>`**, where you will learn to mathematically manipulate these grids to extract new environmental insights.
