```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

A raster becomes far more powerful once it is no longer just a 2D grid, but a labeled data cube that can be explored across space, time, bands, and variables. 

```

**Time to Read:** 15 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Learn how the xarray library organizes massive 3D+ environmental grids using human-readable dimension names instead of complex array indices.  
**Skip this if:** You are already fully comfortable working with `xarray.Dataset`, `xarray.DataArray`, and the general concept of named dimensions and coordinates.

```

In the previous lesson, you learned how to read spatial grids using Rasterio and process them using NumPy. That workflow is perfect for analyzing a single snapshot of the environment. However, Earth observation is fundamentally about change.

To analyze climate patterns, vegetation growth, or urban heat, you cannot look at one image. You need to process hundreds of repetitive observations simultaneously. This chapter introduces the **{term}`Data cube`** Model, a conceptual shift that prepares you to handle massive, multidimensional environmental datasets using the **{term}`xarray`** library.

## 1. Why xarray after Rasterio?

Rasterio is an excellent translator. It reads a **{term}`GeoTIFF`** file from your hard drive and hands you a pure **{term}`NumPy`** **{term}`array <Array>`**. While NumPy is incredibly fast at math, it is completely blind to context.

If you load a massive climate dataset, NumPy might tell you the array shape is `(2920, 25, 53)`. But that raw matrix does not tell you which axis is time, which axis is latitude, or what the units are. If you want to find the temperature for Zurich on July 1st, you have to mentally calculate the exact numeric index for that day, row, and column. This leads to code that is difficult to read and highly prone to silent errors.

The `xarray` library solves this exact problem. It brings the intuitive labeling power of Pandas directly into the multidimensional matrix operations of NumPy.

Just as `geopandas` makes tabular data spatially aware, a companion library called `rioxarray` provides robust GIS capabilities on top of `xarray`. Together, they allow you to read, project, and manipulate raster data using named dimensions (`time`, `lat`, `lon`) and coordinates, rather than raw numerical indices.

---

## 2. The third dimension and beyond

To understand `xarray`, you must shift your perspective from a flat map to a multidimensional cube.

A traditional satellite image or Digital Elevation Model exists in two spatial dimensions: X (longitude) and Y (latitude). Imagine taking a new satellite image of the exact same location every day for a year. If you physically stack these images on top of one another like pages in a book, the depth of that stack becomes a third dimension: **Time**.

The resulting structure is a Data Cube.

Within this cube, every single geographic pixel is no longer just a static value. If you select a specific coordinate and drill straight down through the layers of the cube, you extract a complete time series showing exactly how that location changed over the year.

However, environmental data cubes often go beyond just time. A single `xarray` object can align multiple components perfectly over the same geographic grid:

* **Spatial Dimensions:** The X (longitude) and Y (latitude) axes.
* **Temporal Dimensions:** The same raster repeated across days, months, or years.
* **Spectral Dimensions:** Multiple sensor bands (Red, Green, Near-Infrared) stacked together.
* **Data Variables:** Entirely different physical measurements (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) sharing the exact same dimensions.

## 3. DataArray and Dataset

When working with data cubes in Python, `xarray` provides two core data structures. Both of these build directly upon the logic of the `pandas` and `geopandas` libraries you have seen in previous lessons.

Understanding the relationship between these two structures is the foundation of multidimensional analysis.

### The DataArray

A **{term}`DataArray`** is a single labeled variable. You can think of it as the `xarray` equivalent of a **{term}`pandas.Series <Series>`**, but designed to handle multidimensional raster matrices instead of flat columns.

Every `DataArray` consists of four key properties:

* **Values:** The underlying NumPy array containing the raw numbers (e.g., the actual temperature readings).
* **Dimensions (dims):** The named axes of the data (e.g., `time`, `lat`, `lon`).
* **Coordinates (coords):** The specific tick labels along those dimensions (e.g., `2024-05-30`, or `47.3°N`).
* **Attributes (attrs):** A dictionary holding arbitrary **{term}`metadata <Metadata>`** (e.g., units, sensor type, or data source).

:::

### The Dataset

A **{term}`Dataset <Dataset (xarray)>`** is a container that holds multiple DataArrays together.

In environmental science, you rarely measure just one variable. A weather model might predict temperature, precipitation, and wind speed simultaneously. A `Dataset` aligns all these different variables perfectly along the same shared coordinates.

You can think of a `Dataset` as the `xarray` equivalent of a **{term}`geopandas.GeoDataFrame <GeoDataFrame>`**. Just as a GeoDataFrame stores multiple columns of data over the same exact geographic shapes, a Dataset stores multiple physical variables over the exact same multidimensional cube.

*A Dataset aligns multiple variables (DataArrays) inside a single container, sharing the exact same geographic and temporal dimensions. Source: [xarray*](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/data-structures.html#dataset)
:::

### A first look in Python

The built in `air_temperature` tutorial dataset is a perfect way to see how this structure looks in practice.

When you open the file, `xarray` loads the entire container:

```{code-cell} python
import xarray as xr

# Open the tutorial dataset container
ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature")
ds

```

This **{term}`object <Object>`** is a Dataset. In your Jupyter output, you will see it lists the dimensions (`time`, `lat`, `lon`), the coordinates, and a section called "Data variables". Inside that data variables section, there is a single entry called `air`.

If you extract that specific variable using **{term}`dictionary <Dictionary>`** syntax, you pull out the DataArray:

```{code-cell} python
# Extract the single variable from the container
air_temperature_array = ds["air"]
air_temperature_array

```

```{admonition} Key distinction
:class: important

A **DataArray** is one labeled variable (like temperature).  
A **Dataset** is the collection of aligned DataArrays. Most operations you learn will work identically on both structures!

```

## 4. Why labels beat indices

The greatest advantage of the Data Cube model is that you stop writing code based on computer logic and start writing code based on human logic.

Under the hood, the values are still stored as a NumPy array. You can access that raw array with `.values`:

```{code-cell} python
air_matrix = air_temperature_array.values
air_matrix.shape

```

If you work with this raw NumPy array directly, you must remember the meaning of every axis yourself.

```{code-cell} python
# Pure NumPy: you must know that axis 0 is time, 1 is latitude, and 2 is longitude
temperature = air_matrix[100, 12, 20]
temperature

```

That works, but it is fragile. The code no longer tells you what `100`, `12`, and `20` actually mean. You need to remember that:

* `100` refers to the 101st time step
* `12` refers to the 13th latitude
* `20` refers to the 21st longitude

This is exactly the problem that `xarray` solves.

### Positional selection with `isel()`

If you know the array positions but want your code to remain readable, use **index selection** with `isel()`.

```{code-cell} python
# Explicitly name the dimensions while still selecting by position
air_temperature_array.isel(time=100, lat=12, lon=20)

```

This is already safer than raw NumPy indexing because the dimension names make your intention clear.

You can also inspect which labels belong to that selected cell:

```{code-cell} python
sample = air_temperature_array.isel(time=100, lat=12, lon=20)

print(sample)
print("Latitude:", float(sample["lat"]))
print("Longitude:", float(sample["lon"]))
print("Time:", str(sample["time"].values))

```

### Label selection with `sel()`

The real strength of `xarray` is **label selection** with `sel()`. Here you select values using meaningful coordinate labels instead of integer positions.

From the previous example, the selected cell corresponds to:

* `time = "2013-01-26T00:00:00.000000000"`
* `lat = 45.0`
* `lon = 250.0`

Now you can select the exact same value again, but this time using the labels directly:

```{code-cell} python
air_temperature_array.sel(
    time="2013-01-26T00:00:00.000000000",
    lat=45.0,
    lon=250.0
)

```

This is much easier to read because the code itself now tells you what you selected:

* the timestamp `2013-01-26`
* the latitude `45.0`
* the longitude `250.0`

Instead of remembering array positions, you work directly with the labels that give the data meaning.

#### Concept Check: Positional vs. Label Selection

**Scenario:** You have a climate DataArray named `precip` with dimensions `(time, lat, lon)`. You want to extract the precipitation data for the exact date "2024-01-01" at latitude 45.0 and longitude 10.0. Which command should you use?

A) `precip.isel(time="2024-01-01", lat=45.0, lon=10.0)`

B) `precip.sel(time="2024-01-01", lat=45.0, lon=10.0)`

C) `precip[2024, 45, 10]`

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B**
The `.sel()` method is used for **label-based** selection, allowing you to pass the actual human-readable values (like dates and coordinates). The `.isel()` method is strictly for **index-based** positional selection, which requires raw integer array positions (like row 0, column 5).

```

```{admonition} Why are some longitudes greater than 180°?
:class: note

Some global datasets use longitude values from `0` to `360` instead of `-180` to `180`. In that convention, `250.0°` is perfectly valid and corresponds to `-110.0°`. 

```{math}
\lambda_{[-180,180]} =
\begin{cases}
\lambda_{[0,360]} - 360, & \text{if } \lambda_{[0,360]} > 180 \\
\lambda_{[0,360]}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

```

Both values describe the same location on Earth. This is common in climate and Earth system datasets because it keeps longitude coordinates continuous across global grids.

## 5. Multidimensional data formats

`xarray` is domain agnostic. It acts as a universal translator that reads from and writes to a variety of scientific file formats. Because multidimensional environmental datasets are massive and often heterogeneous, these file formats use hierarchical structures—meaning they organize data into "groups" that act exactly like folders on your computer.

Depending on your project, you will encounter four major storage formats:

* **GeoTIFF and COG (`.tif`)**: You already know GeoTIFFs from the previous lesson. They map perfectly to a single `xarray.Variable`. However, TIFFs are inherently two dimensional per band. They have no native concept of a time axis or a vertical altitude axis. If you need 4D data, you must move beyond TIFFs. A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a modern upgrade that allows you to stream specific geographic windows over the internet, which `xarray` handles transparently.
* **HDF5 (`.h5` or `.hdf5`)**: The Hierarchical Data Format is a heavy duty, general purpose container for large scientific data. It behaves exactly like a UNIX filesystem. It contains "Groups" (folders), "Datasets" (multidimensional arrays), and "Attributes" (metadata). It supports advanced chunking and compression, making it a powerhouse for complex, nested data structures.
* **{term}`NetCDF` (`.nc`)**: The classic standard in climate and oceanography. Interestingly, modern NetCDF4 is actually built directly on top of HDF5! It is an "opinionated subset" of HDF5 that enforces strict rules about how dimensions and coordinates must be defined. Because it requires explicit dimension scales, it maps perfectly to the `xarray` Dataset structure.
* **{term}`Zarr` (`.zarr`)**: The modern format built for the cloud. While HDF5 and NetCDF are traditionally single massive files, Zarr stores data as a tree of groups holding arbitrary JSON metadata and thousands of tiny, separate chunked arrays. If you want to analyze a ten year temperature trend for one specific city, Zarr allows `xarray` to stream just the tiny chunks for that specific location directly from a remote server without downloading the rest of the globe.

```{admonition} The key takeaway
:class: note

Your code will use `xarray` to do the thinking, the labeling, and the math in memory, but it will rely on formats like GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, and Zarr to persistently and safely store those multidimensional results on disk.

```

## 6. Exercise: Thinking in cubes

Look again at the interactive cube visualizer and the examples in this chapter.

**Your task:**

1. Name three possible dimensions of an environmental data cube.
2. Explain the difference between a **DataArray** and a **Dataset** in one or two sentences.
3. Explain why label based selection is easier to read than pure NumPy indexing.
4. Give one example of a scientific question that requires a data cube instead of a single raster.

```{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

A good answer could be:

1. Three common dimensions are `time`, `lat`, and `lon`. Other possible dimensions are `band`, `x`, `y`, or `level`.
2. A `DataArray` stores one labeled variable together with its dimensions, coordinates, and metadata. A `Dataset` is a container that stores multiple aligned DataArrays sharing the same coordinates.
3. Label based selection is easier to read because it uses meaningful values such as dates and coordinates instead of raw integer positions.
4. A question such as “How did air temperature change at one location over two years?” requires a data cube because it needs repeated observations through time.
```

## 7. Summary

The Data Cube model is a structural paradigm that combines fast matrix operations with explicit spatial and temporal labels using the `xarray` library.

* **The Third Dimension:** Adding dimensions (like time or altitude) transforms a static 2D raster into a dynamic, multidimensional data cube.
* **Core Structures:** A `DataArray` holds a single variable and its labels (similar to a `pandas.Series`), while a `Dataset` acts as a container for multiple perfectly aligned variables (similar to a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`).
* **Human Logic:** Using label based selection (`.sel()`) makes spatial querying intuitive, self documenting, and infinitely safer than guessing raw NumPy integer indices.
* **Storage Formats:** While `xarray` handles the math in memory, it relies on advanced hierarchical and cloud optimized formats like GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, and Zarr to persistently store massive datasets on disk.

Now that you understand the underlying anatomy of a data cube, you are ready to learn how to actively slice, mask, and aggregate these multidimensional arrays in the next chapter.
