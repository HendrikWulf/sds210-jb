```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

List comprehension is a **compact loop pattern**.

It combines:
- iteration (looping)
- optional filtering (`if`)
- optional transformation (math/logic)

...into a single, readable line of code.

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★☆☆ (Helpful for concisely printing formatted outputs like in Part 7: Median and ordering, but the entire lab can be completed using standard loops.)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★☆ (A powerful tool for scoring high on Efficiency [Criteria 9] and Readability [Criteria 7] by compressing boilerplate data extraction across all projects 1-4.)  
**Foundation:** ★★☆ (An elegant Pythonic syntax shorthand, though standard loops are logically sufficient to accomplish the same tasks.)  

**Time to Read:** 20 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Compress standard append boilerplate operations into direct single-line extractions without sacrificing code execution velocity.  
**Skip this if:** You can accurately write single-line comprehensions and know exactly where filtering `if`s versus transforming `if-else`s position relative to the `for` keyword.

```

List comprehension does **not** introduce new logic to Python. It simply repackages patterns you already understand into a shorter, and often clearer, form.

---

## 1. Why list comprehension exists

### From boilerplate to patterns

So far, whenever you needed to create a new **{term}`list`** based on an old list, you used the standard "append pattern":

1. Create an empty list
2. Start a `for` loop
3. Apply a condition or transformation
4. Append the new value to the list

```{code-cell} python
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_values = []

for v in values:
    if v % 2 == 0:
        even_values.append(v)

```

This pattern is correct, explicit, and used constantly. List comprehension exists specifically because this pattern is **so common** that Python created a shortcut for it.

### A refinement, not a replacement

List comprehension:

* does not replace `for` loops entirely
* does not introduce new computational behavior
* simply shortens a well-understood pattern

You should always be able to rewrite a list comprehension as a normal `for` loop, and vice versa.

---

## 2. The basic structure

### One loop in one expression

The simplest form of a list comprehension squashes the loop and the append action into a single line wrapped in square brackets `[]`.

```python
[new_value for item in collection]

```

:::{figure} images/09_list_comp_basic.png
:alt: Syntax breakdown of a basic list comprehension showing the expression, loop variable, and collection.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*Every list comprehension requires these three core parts wrapped in square brackets: the output expression, the loop variable, and the collection to iterate over.*
:::

Example:

```{code-cell} python
values = [2, 4, 6]
squared = [v ** 2 for v in values]
squared

```

To read this easily, read the middle first, then the left:

> "For every `v` in `values`, take `v ** 2` and put it in a new list."

### Relation to a for loop

The following two blocks do the exact same thing:

```{code-cell} python
# Standard Loop
cubed = []
for v in values:
    cubed.append(v ** 3)
cubed

```

```{code-cell} python
# List Comprehension
cubed = [v ** 3 for v in values]
cubed

```

The logic is identical. Only the **form** is different.

---

## 3. Filtering values with conditions

### Adding an if clause at the end

List comprehensions can also include a condition to filter out unwanted data. When filtering, the `if` statement goes at the **very end** of the **{term}`expression`**.

```python
[new_value for item in collection if condition]

```

:::{figure} images/10_list_comp_filtering.png
:alt: Syntax breakdown of a list comprehension with an if-condition at the end for filtering.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*When filtering data, the `if` condition always acts as a gatekeeper at the very end of the expression.*
:::

Example:

```{code-cell} python
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_values = [v for v in values if v % 2 == 0]
even_values

```

Only values that satisfy the condition (`v % 2 == 0`) are allowed into the new list.

### Example: Valid environmental measurements

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [3, -5, 7, 42, 9]
valid = [t for t in temperatures if -20 <= t <= 40]
valid

```

This expresses a **data quality filter** cleanly in just one line.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

Use list comprehensions strictly for **building new lists**, not for printing or executing side effects.

```

---

## 4. Transforming values

### Changing values while building the list

The "expression" part at the front of the list comprehension doesn't just have to be the variable itself; it can be a mathematical transformation.

```{code-cell} python
values = [1, 2, 3]
doubled = [v * 2 for v in values]
doubled

```

### Example: Unit conversion

```{code-cell} python
temperatures_c = [0, 5, 10, 15]
temperatures_k = [t + 273.15 for t in temperatures_c]
temperatures_k

```

This is a clean, Pythonic way to express a systematic transformation of spatial or environmental data.

---

## 5. If–else inside list comprehension

### Conditional transformation (Choosing between two values)

Sometimes you don't want to drop a value completely (filtering), but rather change it based on a condition.

If you need an `if-else` decision, the syntax changes. The entire `if-else` block must move to the **beginning** of the comprehension, before the `for` loop.

```python
[value_if_true if condition else value_if_false for item in collection]

```

:::{figure} images/11_list_comp_ifelse.png
:alt: Syntax breakdown of a list comprehension showing an if-else conditional expression placed at the beginning before the for loop.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*When transforming data conditionally, the entire `if-else` logic becomes the "output expression" and must be placed at the very beginning of the brackets.*
:::

Example:

```{code-cell} python
values = [3, -1, 5, -2]
labels = ["valid" if v >= 0 else "invalid" for v in values]
labels

```

Read this as:

> "Put 'valid' if `v` is >= 0, else put 'invalid'... do this for every `v` in `values`."

### Readability rule

The syntax for `if-else` inside a list comprehension can get visually messy very quickly.

Shorter code is **not** better if it is harder to understand. If a list comprehension becomes too long or complex, rewrite it as a standard `for` loop!

#### Concept Check: The Syntax Shift Barrier

Suppose you are refactoring a loop that cleans up an environmental logger list by applying the following rule: Keep positive readings unchanged, but clip negative entries straight to `0`.

```python
# Raw loop template
clipped = []
for val in tracking:
    if val >= 0:
        clipped.append(val)
    else:
        clipped.append(0)

```

Which syntax layout maps this conditional transformation logic accurately into a single-line list comprehension framework?

A) `clipped = [val if val >= 0 else 0 for val in tracking]`

B) `clipped = [val for val in tracking if val >= 0 else 0]`

C) `clipped = [val for val in tracking if val >= 0]`

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: A** Because this operation relies on an `if-else` choice to modify elements rather than dropping them, the entire conditional sequence must sit at the *beginning* of the collection expression wrapper as a transformed block output selector. Option A represents invalid syntax, while Option C drops values entirely instead of substituting them with 0.

```

## 6. When to use list comprehension

### Good use cases

List comprehensions work beautifully when:

* building a new list from an old one
* applying a simple mathematical transformation
* filtering values based on a single condition
* the logic fits comfortably and readably on one line

### When not to use it

Avoid list comprehension when:

* the logic involves complex nested loops
* you need multiple `elif` conditions
* you are updating external variables or printing
* readability suffers

In those cases, stick to a normal `for` loop.

## 7. Exercises

The following exercises help you practice **reading, writing, and deciding**
when list comprehension is appropriate.

Focus on **clarity first**, compactness second.

---

### Exercise 1: Rewrite a loop as list comprehension

You are given the following loop:

```{code-cell} python
rainfall = [0, 5, 12, 0, 8, 20]
non_zero = []

for r in rainfall:
    if r > 0:
        non_zero.append(r)

```

Rewrite this using **one list comprehension**.

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
rainfall = [0, 5, 12, 0, 8, 20]
non_zero = [r for r in rainfall if r > 0]
```

**Explanation:**

* the loop iterates over values  
* the condition filters values  
* the result is a new list  

````

---

### Exercise 2: Transform values with context

You are working with elevation values in meters:

```{code-cell} python
elevation_m = [450, 1200, 50, 3200]

```

Create a new list that converts these values to kilometres and rounds them to one decimal place.
You can use Python's built-in `round()` function for this, which takes the number to round and the desired number of decimal places (e.g., `round(value, 1)`).

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
elevation_m = [450, 1200, 50, 3200]
elevation_km = [round(e / 1000, 1) for e in elevation_m]
```

**Explanation:**

* the expression transforms each value  
* the loop structure is implicit  
* the result is clean and readable  

````

---

### Exercise 3: Classify measurements

Given temperature measurements:

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [-5, 3, 18, -12, 25]

```

Create a list of labels:

* `"cold"` for values below `0`
* `"warm"` for values `0` or above

Use **one list comprehension with if–else**.

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [-5, 3, 18, -12, 25]
labels = ["cold" if t < 0 else "warm" for t in temperatures]
```

**Explanation:**

* the condition decides the output value  
* every input value produces exactly one label  

````

---

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

If you struggle to read a list comprehension,
rewrite it as a normal `for` loop first.

```

## 8. Summary

### Key ideas

* List comprehension is a **compact loop pattern** used strictly for building new lists.
* It combines looping, filtering, and transformation into one line.
* The `if` goes at the **end** when filtering data.
* The `if-else` goes at the **beginning** when transforming data conditionally.
* It improves clarity **only when used carefully**. If it is hard to read, use a standard {term}`loop`.

---

### Choosing the right loop

```text
for loop           → “Repeat an action for each value.”
while loop         → “Repeat an action until a condition changes.”
list comprehension → “Build a new list from existing data.”

```

### What comes next

In the upcoming **practical exercises**, you will combine everything from this module to:

* process small environmental datasets using loops and conditions
* detect invalid values and thresholds
* write clean, Pythonic data structures for later analysis
