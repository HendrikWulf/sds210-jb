```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

Loops allow the computer to **repeat actions for us**.  
We write the instruction once. The computer does the repetition.


```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★★ (Essential for automating tasks across multiple files or coordinates)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★★ (Data processing at scale is impossible without loops)  
**Foundation:** ★★★ (Core grammar of Python)  

**Time to Read:** 10 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** The `for` loop allows you to write an instruction once and have Python automatically repeat it for every item in a dataset.  
**Skip this if:** You are fully comfortable iterating over lists directly, using `range()` for indexed loops, and writing nested loops.

```

Programs become powerful when they can repeat work automatically.
Loops are the main tool for expressing repetition in Python.

This section focuses only on **repetition**, not on decisions.
Every example does the same thing each time the loop runs.

## 1. The idea of a loop

### One value at a time

A loop processes values **one after another**.

Instead of writing the same instruction many times, we describe a pattern:

> Take one value, do something, move on to the next value.

This idea applies to many situations, such as:

* printing all values in a **{term}`lists <List>`**
* performing the same calculation repeatedly
* stepping through a sequence in order

The number of repetitions is controlled by the data, not by you.

Consider a simple list of values:

```{code-cell} python
values = [3, 7, 12]


```

When a loop runs over this list, it does **not** see the list all at once. Instead, it works like this:

* first, it sees `3`
* then, it sees `7`
* finally, it sees `12`

At each step, the exact same instructions are executed again.

---

### The loop variable

Each loop introduces a temporary **{term}`variable <Variable>`**.

This variable:

* holds exactly one value at a time
* changes automatically on each repetition
* exists while the loop is running

The name of the loop variable is chosen by you and should be descriptive.

---

### How loops run

Conceptually, a loop always follows the same steps:

1. Take the next value from the sequence
2. Assign it to the loop variable
3. Execute the loop body
4. Repeat until no values remain

Understanding this execution model is more important than memorising syntax.

---

## 2. The for loop

### Iterating over collections

The most common loop in Python is the `for` loop. It is used to iterate over collections such as lists.

```python
for item in collection:
    do_something(item)


```

This line tells Python to take one value from the collection at a time and run the same instructions for each value. Read it like a sentence:

> For each `item` in the `collection`, do something with it.

The loop continues until the collection has no values left.

---

### A concrete example

Consider a simple list of city names:

```{code-cell} python
cities = ["Accra", "Berlin", "Chennai", "Damascus"]


```

Now run the following loop:

```{code-cell} python
for city in cities:
    print(city)

```

Python executes the same `print(city)` instruction four times. Each time, `city` refers to a different value from the list.

The code itself does not change. Only the value of `city` changes.

---

### How Python executes this loop

:::{figure} images/02_loop_iteration_pointer.png
:alt: Diagram showing a loop variable sequentially pointing to elements in a list one by one.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*The loop variable acts as a temporary container. It holds the first value, executes the code, and then automatically moves to the next value until the list is empty.*
:::

Internally, Python proceeds step by step:

1. Assigns `"Accra"` to `city` and runs the loop body
2. Assigns `"Berlin"` to `city` and runs the loop body
3. Assigns `"Chennai"` to `city` and runs the loop body
4. Assigns `"Damascus"` to `city` and runs the loop body
5. Stops because no values remain

At any moment, the loop variable holds **exactly one value**.

---

### Loop body and indentation

Everything indented below the `for` statement belongs to the loop.

```{code-cell} python
for city in cities:
    print(city)
    print("---")

```

Both `print` statements are part of the loop body, so both run once for each city.

When the indentation ends, the loop ends. Python does not use an explicit “end loop” keyword. Structure is defined entirely by indentation.

---

### Loop variable lifetime

The loop variable is a **normal variable**. It is assigned a new value on each repetition.

After the loop finishes:

* the variable still exists
* it contains the **last value** from the collection

You can verify this directly:

```{code-cell} python
print(city)

```

This behaviour can be surprising at first, so it is important to be aware of it.

```{admonition} Note
:class: note

The loop variable does not disappear when the loop ends!

```

## 3. Looping with range

### Repeating a fixed number of times

Sometimes you do not want to loop over a list. You simply want to repeat an action a **known number of times**.

This is what `range()` is for.

```{code-cell} python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

```

The loop runs five times. On each repetition, the loop variable takes on the next number in the sequence.

---

### How range works

When `range()` is given a single number, it produces a sequence of integers:

```{code-cell} python
range(5) # Conceptually produces: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

```

Important details:

* the sequence always starts at `0` (unless specified otherwise)
* the final value is **not included** (it stops *before* 5)
* the length of the sequence matches the number you provide (5 numbers total)

This "start at zero, stop before the end" behaviour is the standard in Python.

---

### Start, stop, step

The `range()` function can take one, two, or three arguments.

```python
range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)

```

For example:

```{code-cell} python
for i in range(2, 9, 3):
    print(i)

```

Read this as:

> Start at **2**, increase by **3** each time, stop before reaching **9**.

```{admonition} What would be the output of range(4, 15, 3)?
:class: dropdown

4
7
10
13

```

Using these arguments gives you precise control over how many repetitions occur.

You can learn a bit more about range by typing `help(range)`.

```python
help(range)

```

```text
Help on class range in module builtins:

class range(object)
 |  range(stop) -> range object
 |  range(start, stop[, step]) -> range object
 |
 |  Return an object that produces a sequence of integers from start (inclusive)
 |  to stop (exclusive) by step.  range(i, j) produces i, i+1, i+2, ..., j-1.
 |  start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted!  range(4) produces 0, 1, 2, 3.
 |  These are exactly the valid indices for a list of 4 elements.
 |  When step is given, it specifies the increment (or decrement).
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 ...

```

## 4. Looping with index values

### When values are not enough

So far, you have looped directly over the values in a list. In many cases, this is exactly what you want.

Sometimes, however, you also need to know **where** a value appears in a list. This is where **{term}`index <Index>`** values become useful.

### Accessing values by index

Recall that list elements are accessed using an index. The first element has index `0`.

We can combine this idea with `range()` and `len()`.

```{code-cell} python
cities = ["Buenos Aires", "São Paulo", "Lima", "Bogotá", "Santiago"]

for i in range(len(cities)):
    print(f"{cities[i]} is at index {i}")

```

Here is what happens:

* `len(cities)` gives the number of elements in the list (5)
* `range(5)` produces the indices `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`
* `i` takes on each index value step-by-step
* `cities[i]` accesses the corresponding city

---

### Why the loop starts at zero

Because Python lists start at index `0`,
the first value in the list is accessed as `cities[0]`.

Using `range(len(cities))` ensures that:

* every valid index is used
* no index goes out of bounds

This pattern is common and worth recognising.

---

### Using indices with related lists

Index-based loops are especially useful when you have **multiple lists that belong together**.

```{code-cell} python
cities = ["Buenos Aires", "Brasília", "Lima", "Bogotá", "Santiago"]
countries = ["Argentina", "Brazil", "Peru", "Colombia", "Chile"]

```

Each city corresponds to a country at the same index.

```{code-cell} python
for i in range(len(cities)):
    print(cities[i], "is the capital of", countries[i])

```

The index `i` allows access to matching elements from both lists at the exact same time.

````{admonition} The Pythonic Way (zip)
:class: tip

While `range(len())` is great for understanding how indices work, Python has a built-in function specifically for looping over multiple lists at once called `zip()`.

```{code-cell} python
for city, country in zip(cities, countries):
    print(city, "is the capital of", country)

```

This does the exact same thing, but is cleaner and easier to read!

````

---

### When index-based loops are needed

Using indices is useful when:

* you need to update values in a list
* you want to refer to the position of an element
* you need to access multiple related lists together

In many other cases, looping directly over values
is simpler and clearer.

---

```{admonition} Values vs. Indices
:class: note

If you only need the values,  
loop over the values.

If you need positions or coordination  
between lists, use indices.
```

---

## 5. Nested loops

### Repetition inside repetition

A loop can be placed **inside another loop**. This is called a **nested loop**.

```python
for a in first_list:
    for b in second_list:
        print(a, b)

```

In this structure:

* the **outer loop** controls the larger repetition
* the **inner loop** runs fully from start to finish for *each* outer value

---

### An example

Consider two small lists:

```{code-cell} python
colors = ["red", "blue"]
shapes = ["circle", "square"]

```

Now run the nested loop:

```{code-cell} python
for color in colors:
    for shape in shapes:
        print(color, shape)

```

Each color is combined with **every** shape before the outer loop moves on to the next color.

---

### Execution order

Nested loops always follow the same order:

1. The outer loop takes its first value
2. The inner loop runs through all its values
3. The outer loop moves to the next value
4. The inner loop runs again from the beginning

This creates a grid-like pattern of repetition.

---

### Visualising the pattern

You can think of nested loops as filling a table or a spatial grid:

* rows correspond to the outer loop
* columns correspond to the inner loop

:::{figure} images/03_nested_loops_grid.png
:alt: A 2D grid showing execution flow moving row by row, illustrating how an outer loop and inner loop interact.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*The outer loop locks into a row, while the inner loop runs through all the columns. Once a row is finished, the outer loop moves down one step and the inner loop starts over.*
:::

Every cell represents one execution of the inner loop body. This is incredibly useful in spatial data science for working with coordinate pairs `(x, y)` or raster pixels!

```{admonition} Exponential growth
:class: caution

Nested loops can grow quickly. Each extra loop multiplies the number of repetitions. Looping through 100 X coordinates and 100 Y coordinates results in 10,000 repetitions!

```

#### Concept Check: The Daily Station Processing

You have a list of 5 weather stations and a list of 365 days. You write a nested loop to calculate the daily average temperature for each station (outer loop: stations, inner loop: days). How many times will the inner temperature calculation run?

A) 365 times

B) 5 times

C) 1825 times

````{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: C**
Nested loops act as a multiplier. The outer loop runs 5 times (once for each station), and for *each* of those stations, the inner loop runs 365 times (once for each day). 5 multiplied by 365 equals 1825 total executions.
````

## 6. Exercises

These exercises help you practise the core idea of repetition using loops.  
Focus on **understanding what happens**, not on writing the shortest code.

---

### Exercise 1: Looping over values

You are given a list of elevations (in meters):

```{code-cell} python
elevations = [450, 1200, 890, 2300]
```

1. Write a `for` loop that prints each elevation.
2. Run the code and observe the output.
3. How many times does the loop body execute?

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
for elevation in elevations:
    print(elevation)
```

The loop runs **four times**, once for each value in the list.

**Key idea:**
The loop adapts automatically to the number of values.

````

---

### Exercise 2: Repeating with `range()`

Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 5. Use `range()` to control the number of repetitions.

1. Write the loop.
2. Explain why the stop value is not printed.

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

The loop stops before reaching `6`.

**Key idea:**
`range(start, stop)` includes the start value but excludes the stop value.

````

---

### Exercise 3: Looping with index values

You are given two related lists:

```{code-cell} python
cities = ["Quito", "La Paz", "Asunción"]
countries = ["Ecuador", "Bolivia", "Paraguay"]
```

1. Use an index-based loop to print each city together with its country.
2. Why does looping directly over `cities` not work in this case?

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
for i in range(len(cities)):
    print(cities[i], "is in", countries[i])
```

Looping directly over `cities` gives you the city names,
but not the matching position in the `countries` list.

**Key idea:**
Indices allow coordination between multiple lists.

````

---

### Exercise 4: Nested loops and grids

You are given x and y coordinates:

```{code-cell} python
x_coords = [3, 4, 5]
y_coords = [8, 9]
```

1. Write a nested loop that prints all `(x, y)` coordinate pairs.
2. How many times does the inner loop run in total?

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
for x in x_coords:
    for y in y_coords:
        print(x, y)
```

The inner loop runs **six times** in total.

**Key idea:**
The total number of repetitions is
`len(x_coords) × len(y_coords)`.

````

---

### Exercise 5: Predict before you run

Without running the code, predict the output:

```python
values = [10, 20, 30]

for v in values:
    print(v)
print(v)

```

1. What is printed by the loop?
2. What is printed by the final `print(v)`?

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

The loop prints:

```text
10
20
30
```

The final `print(v)` prints:

```text
30
```

**Key idea:** The loop variable still exists after the loop and holds the last value.
````

---

## 7. Summary

In this section, you learned how Python expresses **repetition** using loops.

### Key ideas

* A loop processes values **one at a time**
* The loop variable holds **one value per iteration**
* `for` loops are used to iterate over collections
* `range()` controls repetition when no list is involved
* Index-based loops allow access to positions and related lists
* Nested loops combine repetition across multiple dimensions

```{admonition} Mental models to remember
:class: tip

A loop answers the question:  
“How do I do the same thing many times?”

* The code inside the loop stays the same
* Only the loop variable changes
* Indentation defines what is repeated
```

---

### What comes next

So far, all loops have repeated the **same action**.

Next, we will introduce **conditions**, which allow loops to behave differently for different values. Repetition is about to become **decision-aware**.
