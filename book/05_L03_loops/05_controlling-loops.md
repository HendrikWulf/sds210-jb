```{admonition} Big idea
:class: tip

Loops do not always need to run to the end.

Python provides small keywords that let you  
**stop a loop early**, **skip an iteration**,  
or **leave a placeholder while drafting code**.

```

```{admonition} Chapter Relevance
:class: dropdown

**Lab Relevance:** ★★☆ (Crucial for successfully completing Part 6: Stopping early with `break`, ensuring you can halt iterations exactly when a threshold is breached.)  
**Project Relevance:** ★★☆ (Essential for building robust error-handling blocks [Criteria 8] and safely skipping corrupted or missing data entries in projects 1, 2, 3, and 4.)  
**Foundation:** ★★☆ (Core architectural commands that give you explicit internal management over any running iteration block.)  

**Time to Read:** 15 minutes  
**In a nutshell:** Gain fine-grained control over execution structures by learning to actively skip items or halt loop lifespans dynamically from the inside out.  
**Skip this if:** You can accurately contrast how `pass`, `break`, and `continue` alter the execution stack, and how `continue` changes behavior inside a `while` loop versus a `for` loop.

```

---

So far, loops have followed a strict and predictable pattern: start, repeat, and stop only when the main loop condition is met or the data runs out.

Now we add a powerful new capability:

> You can control the loop's flow **from inside the loop body**.

This is incredibly useful for data checking, quality control, and making your processing more efficient.

---

## 1. Placeholders with `pass`

### Why pass exists

Sometimes you want to sketch out the structure of your code before you actually know what the logic should be.

However, Python relies on {term}`indentation`. If you create a `for` loop or an `if` statement and leave the indented block completely empty, Python will throw an error.

`pass` is a placeholder {term}`statement` that literally does nothing. It simply tells Python, *"I know a block of code belongs here, just ignore it for now."*

```{code-cell} python
for i in range(5):
    pass  # Keeps the code valid while you are drafting

```

This loop runs perfectly, but performs no action.

### When to use pass

Use `pass` when you:

* sketch out a loop you will complete later
* create a temporary placeholder while debugging
* need a code block that is syntactically required but intentionally empty

```{admonition} Doing nothing
:class: note

`pass` does nothing on purpose. It is **not** the same as “skip this iteration”. It just prevents an indentation error.

```

---

## 2. Exiting a loop with `break`

### Stopping early

The `break` statement is an emergency exit. It ends the loop **immediately**. {term}`Control flow` jumps completely out of the loop and continues with the first line of code *after* the loop block.

This is useful when your goal has been reached and continuing the loop would just be wasted work.

### Example: Stop when an outlier is found

```{admonition} Tracking positions with enumerate()
:class: info
In this example, we want to print a warning that includes both the temperature **and** the specific day it was recorded. 

Instead of dealing with `range(len())`, Python provides a highly readable tool called `enumerate()`. It automatically counts items as it loops, giving you two variables at once: the count (which we call `day`) and the value (`temp`). By adding `start=1`, we tell Python to start counting at Day 1 instead of 0!

```

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 111, 11]
min_temp = -20
max_temp = 40

for day, temp in enumerate(temperatures, start=1):
    print(f"Day {day}: {temp} °C")
    
    if temp < min_temp or temp > max_temp:
        print(f"⚠️ Outlier detected on day {day}: {temp} °C. Stopping analysis!")
        break

print("Finished checking the record.")

```

As soon as the `break` statement is triggered on the 111 °C outlier, the loop is abandoned. The remaining temperature (11 °C) is never checked.

### Why use break?

Without `break`, the loop would uselessly keep checking values even after the problem was found. With `break`, the loop stops early, saving time and processing power.

This is a common pattern when:

* searching for the very first occurrence of a feature
* detecting the onset of an environmental event
* safely stopping a process when an error condition is met

---

## 3. Skipping an iteration with `continue`

### Skip the rest of this round

While `break` stops the entire loop, `continue` only stops the **current {term}`iteration`**. It skips the remaining code in the loop body and immediately jumps back to the top to start the **next iteration**.

This is perfect when some values should be **ignored**, but you still want to process the rest of the dataset.

:::{figure} images/08_break_vs_continue.png
:alt: Side-by-side flowcharts showing 'break' completely exiting a loop boundary, while 'continue' skips the rest of the current block and loops back to the top.
:width: 700px
:align: center

*Notice the difference in the escape paths: `break` shatters the loop entirely and moves on. `continue` acts like a reset button for the current iteration, sending Python straight back to the top to grab the next value.*
:::

### Example: Ignore missing values

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [3, None, 7, 6, None, 9]

for temp in temperatures:
    if temp is None:
        continue  # Skip to the next temperature
        
    print(f"Valid value: {temp} °C")

```

Here, the loop skips the `None` entries without breaking the loop, ensuring the valid temperatures (`7`, `6`, `9`) are still printed.

### What is `None`?

In Python, `None` represents the **absence of a value**. It is commonly used to indicate:

* missing data
* unavailable measurements
* placeholders where no valid value exists

`None` is **not** zero, not an empty string, and not `False`. It is a distinct **{term}`data type`** with a special meaning. Because of this, it is usually checked explicitly using the `is` {term}`operator`.

### A common coding pattern

Often, `continue` is used as a "guard" at the very top of a loop:

```python
for value in dataset:
    if value is None:
        continue
        
    # main, complex processing happens down here

```

This acts as a filter, keeping the main logic less indented and much easier to read.

---

## 4. `continue` and `while` loops

### Why continue can be risky

In a `for` loop, Python automatically fetches the next value from the list when `continue` is called. So, `continue` is very safe to use.

In a `while` loop, **you** are responsible for updating the control variable (like `index += 1`). If `continue` skips the line of code that updates your variable, the loop will evaluate the exact same condition again and again, trapping your program in an **{term}`infinite loop`**.

### Example of the risk

```python
values = [3, None, 7]
index = 0

while index < len(values):
    value = values[index]

    if value is None:
        continue  # DANGER: We skip the index update!

    print(value)
    index += 1    # This line is never reached for None

```

This code prints `3`, and then gets permanently stuck on the `None` value because `index` remains `1` forever.

### The safe pattern

If you use `continue` in a `while` loop, make sure your control variable is updated **before** the `continue` statement is reached.

```{code-cell} python
values = [3, None, 7]
index = 0

while index < len(values):
    value = values[index]
    index += 1  # Update happens FIRST

    if value is None:
        continue

    print(value)

```

Now the loop safely progresses to the end of the list.

```{admonition} Safety check
:class: caution

In a `while` loop, always trace your logic to ensure the loop can still make progress after a `continue` statement is triggered.

```

#### Concept Check: The Execution Pipeline Shunt

Suppose you are tracking spatial telemetry nodes with a loop designed to skip offline gaps or completely abort on an emergency status code indicator:

```python
dataset = [12, None, 15, -999, 18]

for val in dataset:
    if val is None:
        continue
    if val == -999:
        break
    print(val)

```

What is the exact outcome generated by the execution track of this code?

A) It prints 12, skips None, prints 15, prints -999, and then halts.

B) It prints 12, skips None, prints 15, and stops tracking completely at -999 without evaluating 18.

C) It prints 12, prints 15, prints 18, and filters out both None and -999 quietly.

```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: dropdown

**Answer: B** The `continue` statement causes Python to bypass the remaining block layout specifically for the `None` item. When the pointer encounters `-999`, the `break` command shatters the loop completely, skipping line processing for the trailing element `18` entirely.

```

## 5. Exercises

### Exercise 1: Drafting a data check with pass

You are planning to write a quality check for a dataset,
but you are not yet sure what the check should do.

Create a loop that iterates over the indices of a dataset
and prints the index number.

Leave the body of the loop empty for now using `pass`.

```{code-cell} python
data = [12, 15, 18, 21, 24]
```

*Why might this be useful while developing code?*

---

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
data = [12, 15, 18, 21, 24]

for i in range(len(data)):
    pass
```

**Explanation:**

* the loop structure is correct  
* the body is intentionally empty  
* logic can be filled in later without breaking the code  

````

---

### Exercise 2: Stop at the first invalid measurement

You are checking daily temperature measurements.
Values below −20 °C or above 40 °C are invalid.

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 45, 14, 16]

```

Write a loop that:

1. Iterates over the list using an index
2. Prints each day and temperature
3. Stops immediately when an invalid value is found
4. Prints a clear warning using an `f`-string

---

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 45, 14, 16]
min_temp = -20
max_temp = 40

for i in range(len(temperatures)):
    temp = temperatures[i]
    print(f"Day {i + 1}: {temp} °C")

    if temp < min_temp or temp > max_temp:
        print(f"⚠️ Invalid measurement on day {i + 1}")
        break
```

**Explanation:**

* indexing makes the day number explicit  
* `break` stops the loop as soon as the decision is made  
* the loop’s intent is detecting the first error  

````

---

### Exercise 3: Skip missing values but keep counting

You are processing sensor data where some measurements are missing (`None`).

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [3, None, 6, 7, None, 9]

```

Write a loop that:

1. Iterates over the list
2. Skips missing values
3. Prints only valid temperatures
4. Includes the position in the output

---

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
temperatures = [3, None, 6, 7, None, 9]

for i in range(len(temperatures)):
    temp = temperatures[i]

    if temp is None:
        continue

    print(f"Valid value at position {i}: {temp} °C")
```

**Explanation:**

* `continue` ignores invalid entries  
* indexing preserves positional information  
* output stays readable and informative  

````

---

### Exercise 4: Decide whether to break or continue

Consider the following dataset:

```{code-cell} python
values = [10, 12, None, 15, -999, 18]

```

Assume:

* `None` means *missing* and should be skipped
* `-999` means *corrupted* and should stop processing

Write a loop that:

* skips `None` values
* stops entirely when `-999` is encountered
* prints all valid values before stopping

Think carefully about **where** to use `continue`
and **where** to use `break`.

---

````{admonition} Sample solution
:class: dropdown

```{code-cell} python
values = [10, 12, None, 15, -999, 18]

for i in range(len(values)):
    value = values[i]

    if value is None:
        continue

    if value == -999:
        print(f"⚠️ Corrupted value at position {i}")
        break

    print(f"Value at position {i}: {value}")
```

**Explanation:**

* `continue` skips missing values  
* `break` stops processing when data is corrupted  
* different control statements express different intent  

````

---

## 6. Summary

* `pass` is a placeholder that does nothing.
* `break` exits a loop entirely and immediately.
* `continue` skips the remainder of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

`break` and `continue` are most useful when processing real-world data, because they allow your program to react dynamically to missing, corrupted, or target values.

---

### What comes next

Next, you will combine everything you have learned:

* repetition with `for` and `while`
* decisions with `if`, `elif`, `else`
* loop control with `pass`, `break`, and `continue`

This gives you a complete toolkit for writing programs that can automate spatial logic and react to real data in a controlled, intelligent way.
