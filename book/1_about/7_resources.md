# Resources

Learning **Spatial Data Science (SDS)** is a bit like learning a new language *and* how to use it to solve real-world problems.  
The resources below support different stages of your learning journey — whether you want to **strengthen your Python basics**, **learn geospatial workflows**, or **think more deeply about spatial data science**.

All resources listed here are:

- free and openly available  
- widely used in university teaching  
- well aligned with the SDS mindset (practical, reproducible, problem-oriented)

```{admonition} How to use these resources
:class: tip

You are **not expected to read, listen or watch everything**.

Use these materials to:
- clarify concepts you did not fully understand in class,
- practice coding at your own pace,
- explore topics that spark your curiosity.

Spatial Data Science is learned best by **doing**, **making mistakes**, and **iterating**.
