# AI

## Use of AI in this course

AI tools such as large language models (LLMs) can be valuable companions when learning Python programming, **if used intentionally and responsibly**.

In this course, you may use AI tools (e.g. [Copilot](https://www.zi.uzh.ch/de/staff/software-elearning/copilot.html), ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to:
- clarify Python syntax and concepts,
- debug errors and understand error messages,
- explore alternative implementations or approaches,
- improve code readability and documentation.

Used well, AI can help you learn faster and work more efficiently.

### AI Is a Learning Aid, Not a Replacement

The goal of this course is not to produce working code as quickly as possible, but to develop:
- a solid understanding of **Python programming concepts**,
- the ability to **reason about code**,
- confidence in **explaining and justifying your solutions**.

If an AI tool provides a complete solution that you cannot explain or adapt, it is **not helping your learning**.  
AI should *support* your thinking, not replace it.

### Expectations for This Course

When using AI tools, you are expected to:

- remain actively involved in the problem-solving process,
- understand and be able to explain all submitted code,
- treat AI-generated output as **suggestions**, not authority,
- critically review, test, and adapt any AI-assisted code.

You are responsible for everything you submit, regardless of whether AI was involved.

### Transparency and Responsibility

Using AI is allowed in this course, but **uncritical copy-paste is not**.  
If AI played a substantial role in your solution, be prepared to explain:
- what you asked the tool,
- what you changed,
- and why the final solution works.

This reflects real-world programming practice, where understanding and accountability matter more than speed.

```{admonition} Key takeaway
:class: tip

Use AI to **support learning**, not to bypass it.  
If you can explain your code confidently, you are using AI in the right way.
