# Error Culture

Errors are a normal and essential part of learning anything, especially in a programming-focused course. Writing code that does not work as expected is not a failure. It is a key mechanism through which understanding develops.

Error messages, unexpected results, and broken scripts provide valuable information about how Python interprets your instructions and where assumptions or mental models do not yet match the behaviour of the code.

Learning to read, interpret, and resolve errors is therefore a core learning objective of this course.

## Learning Through Productive Struggle

During the course you will encounter syntax errors, confusing error messages, and code that only partially works. This is expected.

Working through these situations helps you develop practical skills in debugging, reasoning about code, and identifying the source of a problem. These skills are transferable and essential for working with real data and real systems, where solutions are rarely straightforward.

Progress in programming often comes in small steps, through testing, adjusting, and trying again.

## Asking Questions and Discussing Errors

If something does not work or does not make sense, you are encouraged to ask questions during labs or via Teams. Discussing errors openly helps everyone learn and reduces the impression that others “got it right” on the first try.

Errors are part of the shared learning experience and discussing them is both expected and valued.

Good programmers are not those who avoid errors, but those who know how to work with them constructively.
